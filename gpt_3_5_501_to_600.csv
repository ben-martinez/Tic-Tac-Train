c_{1,1}  c_{1,2}  c_{1,3}

c_{2,1}  c_{2,2}  c_{2,3}

c_{3,1}  c_{3,2}  c_{3,3}

Based on the given sequence of moves played so far, we can update the game board accordingly:

c_{1,1}  -1  -

c_{2,1}  -1  -

-  -  -

c_{1,2}  1  -

-  -  -

-  1  -

Now, let's check if there are any winning conditions for either player:

-1 + -1 + -1 = -3 (column 1)
-1 + -1 + 1 = -1
-1 + -1 + 0 = -2

-1 + 1 + -1 = -1 (row 2)
-1 + -1 + 0 = -2
0 + 1 + 0 = 1 (diagonal from top left to bottom right)
-1 + 0 + 0 = -1
-1 + 1 + -1 = -1 (diagonal from top right to bottom left)

There are no winning conditions for either player at the moment.

Next, let's check if there are any near-win states for either player:

| -1 + -1 + 0 | = 2 (row 1) - Player 1 (X) can complete the near-win by choosing cell (1, 3)
| -1 + 0 + 0 | = 1 (row 1)
| -1 + -1 + 1 | = 1 (row 2)
| 0 + 1 + 0 | = 1 (row 3)

| -1 + 1 + 0 | = 0 (column 2)
| -1 + -1 + 1 | = 1 (column 3)
| -1 + 1 + -1 | = 1 (diagonal from top right to bottom left)

Player 1 (X) has a near-win state in row 1. Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to choose cell (1, 3) to complete the near-win.

The updated game board after Player 1's move:

c_{1,1}  -1  1

c_{2,1}  -1  -

-  -  -

Player 2's turn. Now, let's check for any near-win states for Player 2:

| -1 + -1 + 1 | = 1 (row 2)

Player 2 has no near-win state.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 2 is to block Player 1's near-win by choosing cell (1, 2).

The updated game board after Player 2's move:

c_{1,1}  -1  1

c_{2,1}  -1  -1

-  -  -

Now, it's Player 1's turn. Let's evaluate the game board for any potential winning moves or near-win states:

-1 + -1 + 1 = -1 (row 2)

Player 1 has no winning moves or near-win states.

Therefore, Player 1 can choose any available empty cell for their next move.

Current Game State:

Now, let's evaluate the game state by checking for any potential winning or near-win conditions:

 O + X + _ = 1
 X + _ + _ = 1

Based on the current game state evaluation, we can see that there are no winning moves for either player. However, we can identify a near-win condition in the first row, where Player 1 (X) has two marks and the third cell is empty. Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 would be to mark the empty cell on the first row.

Analyzing our opponent's potential moves, we can see that if they play at (2, 3), they will have a near-win state in the second row. Therefore, our optimal move will be to block their potential win by playing at (2, 3).

    - Diagonal from top right to bottom left: (-1) + X + 0 = -1 (no winning condition)

There are no winning conditions at the moment. Now, let's check for near-win states. 

- Rows:
    - Row 1: |1 + 0 + (-1)| = 2 and cell (1, 2) is empty
    - Row 2: |-1 + 1 + 0| = 0 (no near-win condition)
    - Row 3: |1 + 0 + 0| = 1 (no near-win condition)

- Columns:
    - Column 1: |1 + (-1) + 1| = 1 (no near-win condition)
    - Column 2: |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 (no near-win condition)

- Diagonals:
    - Diagonal from top left to bottom right: |1 + X + (-1)| = 0
    - Diagonal from top right to bottom left: |-1 + X + 0| = 1 (no near-win condition)

Based on the evaluation, we can see that there is a near-win state for Player 1 in row 1. To block Player 1 from winning, Player 2 should play their move in the empty cell (1, 2).

The optimal next move is (1, 2)."

To determine the optimal next move, I will begin by representing the current state of the game board using the provided matrix notation. 

The sequence of moves played so far: 
[(3, 3), (3, 1), (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (1, 3)]

The game board representation: 
c_{1,1}   c_{1,2}  c_{1,3}
c_{2,1}   c_{2,2}  c_{2,3}
c_{3,1}   c_{3,2}  c_{3,3}

Based on the moves played so far, we can update the matrix to reflect the current state of the game:

1  0  -1
0  1   0
0 -1   0

Now, let's check if there are any near-win states for either player. 

For Player 1 (X):
- Rows:
|1 + 0 + (-1)| = 2 and one of 1, 0, -1 is 0 (near-win state in the first row)
Other rows do not have near-win states for Player 1

- Columns:
|1 + 0 + 0| = 1 and none of 1, 0, 0 is 0 (no near-win state in any column)

- Diagonals:
|1 + 1 + 0| = 2 and one of 1, 1, 0 is 0 (near-win state in the main diagonal)
|(-1) + 1 + 0| = 2 and one of -1, 1, 0 is 0 (near-win state in the opposite diagonal)

For Player 2 (O):
- Rows:
|0 + 1 + 0| = 1 and none of 0, 1, 0 is 0 (no near-win state in any row)

- Columns:
|(-1) + 0 + (-1)| = 2 and one of -1, 0, -1 is 0 (near-win state in the second column)
Other columns do not have near-win states for Player 2

- Diagonals:
|(-1) + 1 + 0| = 2 and one of -1, 1, 0 is 0 (near-win state in the opposite diagonal)
No near-win state in the main diagonal for Player 2

Since there is a near-win state for Player 1 in the first row and near-win states for Player 1 in the main diagonal, Player 1 should prioritize playing a move that will mark the third cell in one of these near-win states.

The optimal next move for Player 1 would be to play in the middle cell of the first row, resulting in the matrix:

1  1  -1
0  1   0
0 -1   0

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is (1, 2)."

Now, let's check if there are any winning conditions for either player:

Based on the above calculations, there are no winning conditions for either player at the moment.

  - `|c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |-1 + 1 + -1| = 1` and `c_{3,1} = -1` (cannot mark the third cell)

  - `|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 0 + -1| = 0` (cannot mark the third cell)
  - `|c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |0 + 1 + -1| = 0` (cannot mark the third cell)
  - `|c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + -1 + -1| = 2` and `c_{1,3} = 0` (can mark the third cell)

  - `|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 1 + -1| = 0` (cannot mark the third cell)

Based on the above calculations, there is one near-win state for Player 2 (O) in the second column, where marking the third cell will result in a win.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is to mark the empty cell in the second column, which is at (1, 2).

The updated game board after the optimal move is made will look like this:

- Player 1 (X):
  - No winning move available.
- Player 2 (O):
  - No winning move available.

Therefore, the optimal next move is to block Player 1's near-win state by marking the third cell at (1, 1).

```
  1  2  3

2    X  O
3 O     X

Now, let's calculate the sums for each row, column, and diagonal:

Rows:
- Row 1: 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0
- Row 2: 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0
- Row 3: (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0

Columns:

- Column 3: (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1

Diagonals:
- Diagonal 1: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Diagonal 2: (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1

Based on the above calculations, we can see that there are no winning conditions or near-win states for either player.

Now, applying the rule 5. Priority of Moves, as Player 1, I will try to find the optimal move that creates a winning condition:

Checking the rows:
- Row 1: 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0 -> No near-win state
- Row 2: 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 -> No near-win state
- Row 3: (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0 -> No near-win state

Checking the columns:
- Column 1: 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0 -> No near-win state
- Column 2: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 -> No near-win state
- Column 3: (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1 -> No near-win state

Checking the diagonals:
- Diagonal 1: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 -> No near-win state
- Diagonal 2: (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1 -> No near-win state

Since there are no near-win states for me, as Player 1, and my opponent doesn't have a near-win state either, I will choose an empty cell randomly. Let's select cell (1, 1) as the optimal next move.

Now, let's evaluate the game board based on the winning conditions and near-win states:

Winning Conditions:
- No winning conditions have been fulfilled yet.

Near-Win States:
- Rows:
    - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |(-1) + 1 + (-1)| = 1, and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0

    - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 1 + (-1)| = 1, and one of c_{1,3}, c_{2,3}, c_{3,3} is 0
- Diagonals:

Based on the above evaluation, we have two near-win situations for Player 2 (O) - one in the top row and another along the diagonals. Since Player 2 can win on the next move, we need to block their potential win by playing in the cell that completes either of the near-win states.

The optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is to play in the empty cell (3, 2) to block Player 2's potential win.

2 O | X |

Now, let's check for any winning conditions:

- Rows:

No diagonal has a sum of +/- 3.

Since there are no winning conditions for either player yet, let's check for near-win states:

- Rows:
```
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + (-1) + 1| = 1 and c_{1,2} = 0
|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |(-1) + 1 + 0| = 0
|c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 0

|c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 0 + (-1)| = 0

Column 2 has a near-win state with an absolute sum of 1 and an empty cell at (3, 2).

- Diagonals:
```
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 1 + (-1)| = 1 and c_{3,3} = 0
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2
```
The main diagonal has a near-win state with an absolute sum of 1 and an empty cell at (3, 3).

Based on the above evaluation, the priority of moves is as follows:

1. If there is a winning move, play it.
2. If there is a near-win state for you, play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win.
3. If your opponent has a near-win condition, block their win by playing your piece to where they would play to get a win condition.
4. Try to create a win as fast as possible.

There is a near-win state in row 1 at position (1, 2). Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 is (1, 2).

|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 0 + 0| = 0, and c_{1,3} = 0

From the near-win states, there is a near-win condition for Player 1 in the first row. To play optimally, Player 1 should mark the third cell in the near-win, which is at position (1, 3).

From this evaluation, we can see that there are no winning conditions for either player yet.

|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |(-1) + (-1) + (-1)| = 3

From this evaluation, we can see that there are no near-win states for either player either.

Since there are no near-win or win conditions for either player, let's analyze the next optimal move based on priority:

Player 1's turn:

There are no near-win or win conditions for Player 1, so we need to consider blocking any potential near-win or win conditions for Player 2.

Player 2's near-win states:
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = 1
|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = 1
|c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = 0
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = 1
|c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = 1
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = 0
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = 1
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = 3

Based on Player 2's near-win states, blocking (2, 2) would prevent a potential win for Player 2 since this completes the diagonal win condition.

Based on the current game state, there are no winning conditions or near-win states for either player.

Now, let's prioritize the moves according to the rules:

1. Check for winning moves:
   - There are no winning moves available for either player.

2. Block the opponent's near-win moves:
   - The opponent (Player 2) has no near-win moves.

3. Make any available near-win moves:
   - There are no near-win moves available for Player 1.

Since there are no specific moves to prioritize according to the rules, we can make any valid move. From the current game state, it appears that the optimal next move for Player 1 is to play at position (3, 3) to mark the last cell:

c_{1,1} = 0   c_{1,2} = 1   c_{1,3} = -1 
c_{2,1} = 1   c_{2,2} = 0   c_{2,3} = -1

    | X | O | O |

    |   | X | O |

Now we need to determine the optimal next move. 

First, let's check if there are any winning conditions for either player:

- Rows:
    - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = X + O + O = -1 (no win condition)
    - c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = X + -1 + -1 = -1 (no win condition)
    - c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = -1 + X + O = -1 (no win condition)

- Columns:
    - c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = X + X + blank = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 (no win condition)
    - c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = O + -1 + X = -1 (no win condition)
    - c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = O + blank + O = -1 + 0 -1 = -2 (no win condition)

- Diagonals:
    - c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = X + -1 + O = 0 (no win condition)
    - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = O + -1 + X = 0 (no win condition)

There are no winning conditions for either player at the moment. 

Next, let's check if there are any near-win states for either player:

- Rows:
    - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |X + O + O| = 1 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0 (no near-win state)
    - |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |X + -1 + -1| = 1 and one of c_{2,1}, c_{2,2}, c_{2,3} is 0 (no near-win state)
    - |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |-1 + X + O| = 0 and one of c_{3,1}, c_{3,2}, c_{3,3} is 0 (no near-win state)

- Columns:
    - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |X + X + blank| = 2 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{2,1}, c_{3,1} is 0 (near-win state for Player 1)
    - |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |O + -1 + X| = 2 and one of c_{1,2}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,2} is 0 (near-win state for Player 2)
    - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |O + blank + O| = 1 and one of c_{1,3}, c_{2,3}, c_{3,3} is 0 (no near-win state)

- Diagonals:
    - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |X + -1 + O| = 0 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,3} is 0 (no near-win state)
    - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |O + -1 + X| = 0 and one of c_{1,3}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,1} is 0 (no near-win state)

Based on the priority of moves rule 5, we should prioritize creating a win if possible. However, since there are no immediate winning moves for either player, we need to focus on blocking the opponent's near-win state.

   | X |   
---+---+---
 X | O | O

To determine the optimal move, let's evaluate the current state based on the winning and near-win conditions.

1. Winning Conditions:
- Rows:
    - `c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1` (Player 1)
    - `c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = -1 + 1 + 1 = 1` (Player 1)

    - `c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (Player 1)
    - `c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1` (Player 1)

    - `c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1` (Player 1)

No winning condition is met at the moment.

2. Near-Win States:

- Rows:
    - `|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + 0 + 0| = 1` (Player 1) - Not a near-win state.
    - `|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |1 + 1 + 1| = 3` (Player 1)
    - `|c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1` (Player 1) - Not a near-win state.

- Columns:
    - `|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |1 - 1 + 0| = 0`
    - `|c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |0 + 1 + 1| = 2` (Player 1) - Not a near-win state.
    - `|c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1` (Player 1) - Not a near-win state.

- Diagonals:
    - `|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2` (Player 1) - Not a near-win state.
    - `|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1` (Player 1) - Not a near-win state.

Based on the evaluation, there is currently no near-win or winning condition for Player 1. However, Player 2 (O) has a near-win condition in the second column, where adding another -1 in the third row would result in a win:

```
   | X |   
---+---+---
 X | O | O 
---+---+---
   | X |   
```

To block Player 2's win, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to place their mark in the empty cell in the third row and second column: (3, 2).

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is (3, 2)."

2   X |   |

Now let's evaluate the current state:

Rows:
- Row 1: 0 + 0 - 1 = -1
- Row 2: 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
- Row 3: 1 - 1 + 0 = 0

Columns:

Diagonals:
- Diagonal 1: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2
- Diagonal 2: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

There are no winning conditions for either player yet. Now let's check for near-win states:

Near-Win States:
- No near-win states for either player.

Since neither player has a near-win state, we must prioritize creating a winning move if possible. Looking at the current state, we can see that:

- Player 1 (X) can create a winning move by marking the cell (3, 1).
- Player 2 (O) does not have a winning move or a near-win state.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to mark the cell (3, 1)."

    -------------

Now, let's evaluate the game board according to the rules:

- Rows:

    - `c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0`
    - `c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1`

- Columns:
    - `c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`
    - `c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = -1 + 1 = 0`
    - `c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = -1`

- Diagonals:
    - `c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + X + (-1) = X`
    - `c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = O`

From the above evaluation, we can observe the following:

1. There are no winning conditions for either player at the moment.
2. There are no near-win states for either player.

Now, according to the priority of moves (rule 5), we need to play optimally. Since there are no winning moves for either player, we need to check if the opponent has a near-win state. If they have a near-win state, we must block their win.

In this case, the opponent (Player 2, O) has a near-win state in the first row. The equation for the near-win state in the rows is:

```
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = 2 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0
```

Here, `c_{1,1} + (-1) + O = 2`, and `O` is empty. So, if Player 1 (X) plays in the cell (1, 2), it will block Player 2's near-win.

Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 is (1, 2).

- c_{1, 3} + c_{2, 2} + c_{3, 1} = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 (not a win)

There are no winning conditions currently in the game.

2. Near-win states:
Checking the rows:
- |c_{1, 1} + c_{1, 2} + c_{1, 3}| = |0 + 1 + 1| = 2 and c_{1, 1} = 0 (near-win)
- |c_{2, 1} + c_{2, 2} + c_{2, 3}| = |0 + 0 + 1| = 1 (not a near-win)
- |c_{3, 1} + c_{3, 2} + c_{3, 3}| = |1 + 0 + 0| = 1 (not a near-win)

Checking the columns:
- |c_{1, 1} + c_{2, 1} + c_{3, 1}| = |0 + 0 + 1| = 1 (not a near-win)
- |c_{1, 2} + c_{2, 2} + c_{3, 2}| = |1 + 0 + 0| = 1 (not a near-win)
- |c_{1, 3} + c_{2, 3} + c_{3, 3}| = |1 + 0 + 0| = 1 (not a near-win)

Checking the diagonals:
- |c_{1, 1} + c_{2, 2} + c_{3, 3}| = |0 + 0 + 0| = 0 (not a near-win)
- |c_{1, 3} + c_{2, 2} + c_{3, 1}| = |1 + 0 + 1| = 2 and c_{1, 3} = 0 (near-win)

Based on the near-win states, we can see that there is an opportunity for Player 1 (X) to win by marking cell (1, 1). This move would create a winning condition in row 1: c_{1, 1} + c_{1, 2} + c_{1, 3} = 1 + 1 + 1 ="

To find the optimal next move, we need to evaluate the current state of the game and check for any winning conditions or near-win states.

1. Winning Conditions:

There are no near-win states for either player as well.

Based on the evaluation of the current game state, there is no winning move available.

To play optimally, we need to consider blocking the opponent's near-win states, if any.

Looking at the evaluation, we can see that the opponent (Player 2) has a near-win state in the first row. To block their win, we should play in the empty cell in the first row at column 2.

Hence, the optimal next move is (1, 2).

Note: It's important to evaluate the game state after every move to make the optimal choice."

2  X | O | 
  -----------
3     | X |
```

Next, let's calculate the summation for each row, column, and diagonal to identify any winning or near-win conditions.

Rows:
- Row 1: 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (no winning condition)
- Row 2: 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0 (no winning condition)
- Row 3: 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (no winning condition)

Columns:
- Column 1: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 (no winning condition)
- Column 2: 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1 (no winning condition)
- Column 3: (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2 (no winning condition)

Diagonals:
- Diagonal from top-left to bottom-right: 0 + (-1) + 0 = -1 (no winning condition)
- Diagonal from top-right to bottom-left: 0 + (-1) + 0 = -1 (no winning condition)

Based on the current game state, there is no winning condition for either player. Now, let's check if there is any near-win state for either player.

Near-win states:
- Player 1 (X):
  - None for Player 1.

- Player 2 (O):
  - Near-win in the first row: |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 2, and c_{1, 3} = 0 (near-win condition)

According to the priority of moves, blocking your opponent's near-win takes precedence over winning yourself. Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to play in the empty cell at (1, 3).

Final game state after the optimal move:

```
   1   2   3
1  O | X | X
  -----------
2  X | O |

- Column 3: 1 + 1 + -1 = 1

Diagonals:
- Diagonal 1: 0 + 1 + -1 = 0
- Diagonal 2: X (not applicable as it doesn't contain the center cell)

There are no winning conditions for either player at the moment.

Now, let's check for near-win states:

Rows:
- Row 1: |0 + 0 + 1| = 1, one of the cells is 0
- Row 2: | -1 + 1 + 1| = 1, one of the cells is 0

Columns:
- Column 1: |0 + -1 + 0| = 1, one of the cells is 0
- Column 2: |0 + 1 + 0| = 1, one of the cells is 0
- Column 3: |1 + 1 + -1| = 1, one of the cells is 0

Diagonals:
- Diagonal 1: |0 + 1 + -1| = 0, one of the cells is 0
- Diagonal 2: X (not applicable as it doesn't contain the center cell)

Based on the current state of the game, there are no near-win states for either player.

Now, let's apply the priority of moves:

Since there are no near-win states for either player, we need to make a blocking move to prevent Player 2 from having a winning move in the next turn.

Player 2 has a potential winning move by marking the empty cell at (1,1) to complete the diagonal containing (2,2) and (3,3). Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) is to mark the cell (1, 1).

The updated game state will be:

 O | X | X

There is no winning condition for either player based on the current board.

Now, let's check for near-win states:

For Player 1 (X):

- Rows:
    |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = |-1| = 1 
        and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0  -> True, c_{1,1} = 0
    |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + 1 + 1| = |2| = 2
        and one of c_{2,1}, c_{2,2}, c_{2,3} is 0  -> True, c_{2,1} = 0
    |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |-1 + 0 + 1| = |0| = 0
        and one of c_{3,1}, c_{3,2}, c_{3,3} is 0  -> True, c_{3,2} = 0

Based on the above, Player 1 has a near-win state in the following cells: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2)

Now, let's check for near-win states for Player 2 (O):

- Rows:
    |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = |-1| = 1
        and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0   -> True, c_{1,1} = 0
    |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + 1 + 1| = |2| = 2

    |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |-1 + 0 + 1| = |0| = 0
        and one of c_{3,1}, c_{3,2}, c_{3,3} is 0   -> True, c_{3,1} = 0

Based on the above, Player 2 also has a near-win state in the following cells: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)

Now, let's consider the priority of moves.

Since Player 1 (X) has a near-win state in the cells (1, 1), (2, 1) and (3, 2), the optimal move for Player 1 would be to mark the third cell to win the game. 

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is (3, 2).

```

Now, we need to check for any winning conditions or near-win states for both players.

For Player 1 (X):
- There are no winning conditions for Player 1 yet.
- There is a near-win state in the second row: `|   + O + X | = 2` and `c_{2, 1} = 0`. This means that if Player 1 marks cell (2, 1), they will have a winning condition.

For Player 2 (O):
- There are no winning conditions for Player 2 yet.
- There is a near-win state in the third column: `| X | X +   | = 2` and `c_{3, 2} = 0`. This means that if Player 2 marks cell (3, 2), they will have a winning condition.

Based on the priority of moves, if it is your turn and you have a winning move, you should play it. Since Player 1 does not have a winning move, the optimal move for Player 1 would be to block Player 2's near-win state.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to mark cell (3, 2).

Final state of the game after Player 1's move:

```

Now, let's evaluate the winning conditions:

- Rows:
  - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 => No win
  - c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = (-1) + 1 + X = 0 => No win
  - c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 => No win

  - c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 => No win

  - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + 1 + 0 = 0 => No win

There are no winning conditions met yet.

Next, let's check for near-win states:

- Rows:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 2 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0 => Near-win state
  - Similar evaluation for other rows

- Columns:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + (-1) + 0| = 1 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{2,1}, c_{3,1} is 0 => No near-win state
  - Similar evaluation for other columns

- Diagonals:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,3} is 0 => No near-win state

There are no winning conditions at this point. Now let's check for any near-win states:

  - `|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + (-1) + (-1)| = 2` (Near-win state)

Since there is a near-win state in the diagonal with sum = -2 and one of c_{1,3}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,1} is 0, we should block the opponent's potential win by playing our piece at (1,3):

        c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0

Based on the current state, we can observe that there are no near-win or winning conditions for either player. 

Now, let's prioritize the moves according to Rule 5. Priority of Moves:
1. If there is a near-win state for the player, play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win.
2. If there are no winning moves, but the opponent has a near-win state, block their win by playing in the cell they would play to achieve the near-win state.

In this case, as there are no near-win or winning conditions, we can select any empty cell for our next move. Let's pick (2, 1) as the optimal next move.

The updated game board after the optimal move is:

- Diagonals:
    - Diagonal 1: 0 + 1 + -1 = 0
    - Diagonal 2: -1 + 1 + 0 = 0

There are no winning conditions or near-win states based on the current state of the game. Since it is now Player 1's turn, we need to evaluate potential winning moves.

Checking the rows:
- Row 1: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 (not a winninng move)
- Row 2: -1 + 1 + 0 = 0 (not a winninng move)
- Row 3: 0 + 0 + -1 = -1 (not a winninng move)

Checking the columns:
- Column 1: 0 + -1 + 0 = -1 (not a winninng move)
- Column 2: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 (not a winninng move)
- Column 3: 1 + 0 + -1 = 0 (not a winninng move)

Checking the diagonals:
- Diagonal 1: 0 + 1 + -1 = 0 (not a winninng move)
- Diagonal 2: -1 + 1 + 0 = 0 (not a winninng move)

Since there are no winning moves available, we need to consider blocking the opponent's near-win condition. Based on the current state, there are no near-win states for the opponent.

Therefore, there is no immediate winning or blocking move available. We should aim to make a move that sets us up for a potential win in the future. Analyzing the current state, one optimal next move could be (1, 1), which marks the top-left cell.

    X | - | X
    ----------
    O | X | -
    ----------
    - | - | O

By marking (1, 1), we create a near-win state in the first row, which gives us more chances for future winning moves.

Near-win state for Player 2 (O):
No near-win states for Player 2.

5. Player 1 (X) marked (3, 3) -> c_{3,3} = 1

Rows:
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + (-1) + (-1)| = 1 != 2
Similar evaluations for other rows.

Columns:

The game board after the given sequence of moves is:

Now let's evaluate the game according to the provided rules:

1. Winning conditions:

Based on the evaluation, we can see that there is a near-win state in the first row where the absolute value of the sum is 2. The empty cells in the first row are (1, 2) and (1, 3). 

To play optimally, we should choose the move that marks the third cell in the near-win state for us. Therefore, the optimal next move is to mark the cell (1, 3) with Player 1's symbol (X).

- Player 2 (O) has a near-win state in the second column: |1+2+0| = 3. One of the cells in the second column is empty (2, 3).

After the first move by Player 1 (X) at position (3, 3), the board becomes:
[0, 0, 0]

After the third move by Player 1 (X) at position (3, 1), the board becomes:

After the fourth move by Player 2 (O) at position (2, 3), the board becomes:

After the fifth move by Player 1 (X) at position (2, 1), the board becomes:

After the sixth move by Player 2 (O) at position (1, 2), the board becomes:
[0, -1, 0]
[1, -1, 1]
[1, 0, 1]

Now, let's identify any near-win states for each player.

Near-win states for Player 1 (X):
- Rows:
|0 + (-1) + 0| = 1 and one of 0, (-1), 0 is 0
- Columns:
|0 + (-1) + 1| = 2 and one of 0, (-1), 1 is 0
Similar for other rows and columns
- Diagonals:
|0 + (-1) + 1| = 2 and one of 0, (-1), 1 is 0
|0 + (-1) + 1| = 2 and one of 0, (-1), 1 is 0

Near-win states for Player 2 (O):
- Rows:

Similar for other rows
- Columns:
|(-1) + (-1) + 0| = 2 and one of (-1), (-1), 0 is 0
- Diagonals:
|0 + (-1) + 1| = 2 and one of 0, (-1), 1 is 0
|(-1) + (-1) + 1| = 3

Based on the current board and near-win states, Player 1 (X) does not have any winning moves. However, Player 2 (O) has a near-win state in column 3 (|(-1) + (-1) + 0| = 2 and one of (-1), (-1), 0 is 0).

To block Player 2's near-win, the optimal move for Player 1 is to play at position (1, 3).

Final game board after the optimal move by Player 1 (X):

  - Columns:

  - Diagonals:
    - None of the diagonals have a near-win state.

Since there are no winning conditions or near-win states for either Player 1 or Player 2, we need to anticipate the best move to increase our chances of winning. 

To determine the optimal next move, we need to consider the priority of moves as defined in rule 5:

1. If there is a near-win state for us, we should play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win.

2. If there is no near-win state for us, but our opponent has a near-win condition, we should block their win by playing our piece where they would play to get a win condition.

In the current game state, there are no near-win states for either player. Therefore, we should prioritize blocking our opponent's win if possible.

Looking at the game board, the only cell that would prevent the opponent from winning immediately is (3, 2). Therefore, the optimal move would be to play at (3, 2).

Final game board after the optimal move:

2. Near-win states:
   - Rows: No near-win states
   - Columns: No near-win states
   - Diagonals: No near-win states

Since there are no winning or near-win states for both players, we should choose a move that blocks the opponent's potential winning move.

By analyzing the current state, we can see that the opponent (Player 2) has two marks in the second column, and if they mark (3, 1), they will win. Therefore, the optimal move for the next player (Player 1) is to mark (3, 1).

The updated game state will be as follows:

```
  0  |  X  |  X

  0  |  O  |  O

Therefore, the optimal next move is (3, 1)."

Let's analyze the current state of the game:

- Winning Conditions:
  - Rows:
    - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 (Not a winning condition)

    - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 0 - 1 + 0 = -1 (Not a winning condition)

Currently, there are no winning conditions present.

- Near-Win States:
  - Rows:
    - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2 (Not a near-win state)
    - |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 - 1 - 1| = 2 (Near-win state for Player 1)
    - |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 0 + 1| = 1 (Not a near-win state)
  - Columns:
    - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |1 - 0 - 0| = 1 (Not a near-win state)
    - |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |1 - 1 + 0| = 0 (Not a near-win state)

    - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |0 - 1 + 0| = 1 (Not a near-win state)

There is a near-win state for Player 1 in the second row. To block their win, the optimal move for Player 2 is to mark the empty cell in the second row. Therefore, the optimal next move is (2, 1).

The updated game board after the optimal move would be:

  - Row 2: 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (Not a winning condition)

Next, let's evaluate the near-win states:

- Rows:
  - Row 1: |1 + 0 + (-1)| = 2 and one of 1, 0, -1 is 0 (Near-win state)
  - Row 2: |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 and none of the values is 0 (Not a near-win state)

  - Diagonal from top right to bottom left: |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 2 and one of 0, 1, -1 is 0 (Near-win state)

Based on the analysis, it is Player 1's turn and there are multiple near-win states available. 

To play optimally, Player 1 should choose the move that marks the third cell in the near-win state, giving priority to creating a winning move. 

Looking at the near-win states, we can see that marking cell (3, 2) will create a winning move in column 2 for Player 1. Thus, the optimal next move for Player 1 is (3, 2).

Based on the current game state, there are no near-win states for any player.

Therefore, to find the optimal next move, Player 1 (X) should search for a winning move or block Player 2 (O) from winning.

From the evaluation, we see a possible winning move for Player 1 (X) by marking cell (1, 2). This move will create a winning condition in the first row (c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2).

- Diagonal 2: O + X + O = 0, no near-win or winning condition.

Based on the current state, there are no near-win states for Player 1 or Player 2. Also, there are no winning conditions for any player.

Since there is no winning move available, we can prioritize blocking the opponent's near-win state. In this case, Player 2 has a near-win state in Diagonal 1 with the empty cell at (1, 1). Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 would be to play at (1, 1).

Now, let's prioritize our moves according to rule 5. Priority of Moves:

1. Check if there is a winning move for us.
2. If there is no winning move for us, check if there is a near-win move for the opponent and block it.
3. If there are no winning or near-win moves, play optimally.

In this case, there are no winning moves for us, as we don't have any row, column, or diagonal with a sum of 3. Therefore, we move on to the next step.

There are also no near-win moves for the opponent, as there is no row, column, or diagonal with a sum of 2 and one empty cell.

Therefore, we move on to playing optimally. Since the board is symmetric, we can choose any empty cell that doesn't lead to a winning move for the opponent.

Based on this, the optimal next move is to choose cell (1, 2) or (2, 1).

Winning conditions:
- No player has three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. 

Near-Win States:
- Rows:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 - 1| = 0 and c_{1,3} = 0. Near-win for Player 1 in row 1.
- Columns: None
- Diagonals: None

Priority of Moves:
- Since there is a near-win state for Player 1 in row 1 (c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 and c_{1,3} = 0), Player 1 should play the move (1, 3) to mark the third cell in the near-win state.

- Columns:

0 + 0 + (-1) ≠ +/- 3

- Diagonals:
1 + (-1) + 0 ≠ +/- 3
(-1) + 0 + 0 ≠ +/- 3

There are no winning conditions at the moment.

To find the near-win states, we need to check the rows, columns, and diagonals for two marks and an empty cell:

- Rows:
|1 + (-1) + 0| = 2 and c_{1,1} = 0
|1 + 0 + 0| = 1
|-1 + 0 + 0| = 1

- Columns:
|1 + 1 + (-1)| = 1
|(-1) + 0 + 0| = 1
|0 + 0 + (-1)| = 1

- Diagonals:
|1 + 0 + 0| = 1
|(-1) + 0 + 0| = 1

Based on the above analysis, there are no near-win states for either player.

Now, let's prioritize our moves according to the rules:

1. Check if there is a winning move for Player 1:
   - There are no winning moves for Player 1.

2. Check if there is a winning move for Player 2:
   - There are no winning moves for Player 2.

3. Block any potential near-win moves by Player 2:
   - There are no near-win moves by Player 2.

Since there are no immediate winning or near-win moves, we can consider any empty cell for our optimal move. From the current game board state, the empty cells are c_{1,3}, c_{2,2}, and c_{3,2}.

Therefore, the optimal next move can be any of the following coordinates: (1, 3), (2, 2), or (3, 2).

Note: The choice between these coordinates depends on the specific strategy or preference of the player."

From the near-win states, we can see that Player 1 has a near-win state in the second row and second column. Player 1 can win the game by marking the third cell in this near-win state.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to mark the cell (2, 3).

- c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
- c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = -1 + -1 + 1 = -1
- c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + -1 + 0 = -1

Columns:
- c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 1 + -1 + 0 = 0
- c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 1 + -1 + -1 = -1
- c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1

Diagonals:
- c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + -1 + 0 = 0
- c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 0 + -1 + 0 = -1

We can see that there are no winning conditions for any player at the moment. Now let's check for near-win states:

Near-win states:
- Row 1: |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2, and c_{1,3} is 0 (Empty cell)
- Column 1: |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + -1 + 0| = 2, and c_{3,1} is 0 (Empty cell)
- Column 2: |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |1 + -1 + -1| = 1
- Column 3: |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1
- Diagonal 1: |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + -1 + 0| = 0
- Diagonal 2: |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + -1 + 0| = 1

Based on the near-win states, we see that there are no near-wins for Player 1 (X). Now let's check if there are any near-win states for Player 2 (O). 

We notice that in Column 2, there is a near-win state for Player 2. The absolute sum is 1, and c_{3,2} = 0 (Empty cell).

To block Player 2's near-win, Player 1 (X) should place their mark in cell (3, 2).

The updated game board matrix becomes:

```
[ X | X | 0 ]
-------------
[ O | O | X ]
-------------
[ 0 | O | X ]
```

Now it is Player 2's turn.

Now, let's evaluate the game board and identify any winning or near-win states:

- Winning state:

Rows:
- c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
- c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = -1 + 1 + 1 = 1
- c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0

Columns:
- c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 1 + -1 + -1 = -1
- c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
- c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

Diagonals:
- c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 0 + 1 + -1 = 0

From the evaluation, we see that there is a winning state in the third row, as the sum of the cells in that row is equal to 2.

Now let's check for near-win states:

- Near-win state:

Rows:
- |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2 (with c_{1,3} being empty)

Based on the evaluation, we have a near-win state in the first row, where the sum of the cells is equal to 2 and c_{1,3} is empty.

As per the priority of moves (rule 5), we should play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win state. In this case, we should play (1, 3) to complete the near-win in the first row.

Therefore, the optimal next move is (1, 3)."

---------------
 1 | X | O |   |

 2 |   | X | O |
---------------
 3 | O |   | X |

Based on the current board, we can evaluate the winning conditions and near-win states:

- Winning conditions:
  - Rows:
    - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 (*not a winning condition*)
    - c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (*not a winning condition*)
    - c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0 (*not a winning condition*)

    - c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 (*not a winning condition*)
    - c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0 (*not a winning condition*)
  - Diagonals:
    - c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (*Player 1 wins*)
    - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (*not a winning condition*)

Player 1 has already won on the diagonal starting from top left to bottom right.

Now let's check the near-win states:

- Rows:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + 0 + 0| = 1 (*not a near-win state*)
  - |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 0 (*not a near-win state*)
  - |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |-1 + 0 + 1| = 0 (*not a near-win state*)
- Columns:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 0 + (-1)| = 0 (*not a near-win state*)
  - |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 (*not a near-win state*)
  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + (-1) + 1| = 0 (*not a near-win state*)
- Diagonals:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 1 + 1| = 3 (*Player 1 wins*)
  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 0 (*not a near-win state*)

Based on the evaluation, we can see that no near-win state is present.

Since Player 1 has already won, Player 2 cannot make any winning moves. In this situation, the optimal move for Player 2 is to choose any empty cell. Let's assume Player 2 chooses cell (3,2).

Now, let's evaluate the game board based on the winning conditions, near-win states, and the priority of moves.

Winning Conditions:
- Rows:
  - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

Priority of Moves:
Based on the evaluation, neither Player 1 nor Player 2 has a winning move. However, there is a near-win state for Player 1 in the first row where c_{1,3} is empty (marked as O). Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is (1, 3).

To block the opponent's near-win state, we should play our piece in the third row. Specifically, we should play in the third column (cell (3, 2)) to prevent the opponent from completing the near-win state in the third row.

  - Diagonal 2: | 0 + 1 + -1 | = 0 and one of 0, 1, -1 is 0

Based on the current board state, we can see that neither player has a near-win state or a winning move. In this case, we need to continue evaluating the game by considering the possible moves.

Possible next moves:
- (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)

To play optimally, we should consider if any of these moves will create a near-win or a winning condition. Let's evaluate each possible move:

- Move (1, 3):
  - Rows:
    - Row 1: -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
  - Columns:
    - Column 3: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
  - Diagonals:
    - Diagonal 2: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
  - This move does not create a near-win or a winning condition.

- Move (2, 3):
  - Rows:
    - Row 2: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
  - Columns:
    - Column 3: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
  - Diagonals:
    - Diagonal 2: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
  - This move does not create a near-win or a winning condition.

- Move (3, 3):
  - Rows:
    - Row 3: 1 + -1 + 0 = 0
  - Columns:
    - Column 3: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
  - Diagonals:
    - Diagonal 2: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
  - This move does not create a near-win or a winning condition.

None of these moves create a near-win or a winning condition. Therefore, we can choose any of the possible moves since there is no optimal move at this point.

Please note that this analysis is based solely on the current state of the game and does not take into account any future moves or strategies that the players might pursue."

Priority of Moves:
- There are no winning moves for either player at this point.
- Player 2 (O) has a near-win state in the second row, as the sum is -2 and one cell is empty. 
  Blocking this near-win state is the priority.
  
The optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is to play at cell (1, 3) to block Player 2's near-win state.

```
  1   2   3
1 -1 | 1 |-1 
2  0 |-1 | 1
3  1 |-1 | 0
```

Now, let's evaluate the game state based on the winning conditions:

- Rows:
```
-1 + 1 + (-1) = -1
0 + (-1) + 1 = 0
1 + (-1) + 0 = 0
```

- Columns:
```
-1 + 0 + 1 = 0
1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
(-1) + 1 + 0 = 0
```

- Diagonals:
```
-1 + (-1) + 0 = -2
1 + (-1) + 1 = 1
```

Based on the above evaluation, there are no winning conditions for either player at the moment.

Next, let's check for any near-win states:

- Rows near-win states:
```
| -1 + 1 + (-1) | = 1 and one of -1, 1, -1 is 0
Similar for other rows
```

- Columns near-win states:
```
| -1 + 0 + 1 | = 2 and one of -1, 0, 1 is 0
Similar for other columns
```

- Diagonals near-win states:
```
| -1 + (-1) + 0 | = 2 and one of -1, -1, 0 is 0
| (-1) + (-1) + 1 | = 1 and one of -1, -1, 1 is 0
```

Based on the above evaluation, there are no near-win states for either player.

As per rule 5, if there is no near-win state for the current player, but the opponent has a near-win condition, the current player should block their win by playing their piece in the cell where the opponent would play to get a win condition.

In our case, there are no near-win states for the opponent as well.

Since there are no winning or near-win conditions, we need to consider our own winning moves. Currently, we do not have a winning move available.

Therefore, there is no optimal move available in this game state. The game seems to be heading towards a draw.

Note: If the game is not a draw and it's still in progress, additional moves need to be provided to determine the optimal move."

---------------------
  2 |  0  |  O  |  X  |
---------------------
  3 |  0  |  O  |  0  |
```

Now let's evaluate the game board according to the rules:

1. Winning conditions:

- Rows:
```
c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 (not a win)
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0 - 1 + 1 = 0 (not a win)
c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 - 1 + 0 = -1 (not a win)

- Columns:
```
c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 (not a win)

```
c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 - 1 + 0 = -1 (not a win)
c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 0 - 1 + 0 = -1 (not a win)
```

2. Near-Win States:

There are no near-win states for either player.

Now, let's apply the priority of moves (rule 5):

Since neither player has a winning move and there are no near-win states, we need to analyze the possible moves. Looking at the board, we can see that the optimal move would be to mark cell (3, 3) with an ""X"" to create a winning condition in the diagonal:

```
    |  1  |  2  |  3  |
---------------------
  1 |  0  |  X  |  0  |
---------------------
  2 |  0  |  O  |  X  |

  3 |  0  |  O  |  X  |

Based on the given sequence of moves, it is currently Player 2's turn (O). There are no near-win states for Player 2, but there is a near-win state for Player 1 (X) in the second row, which can be completed by marking cell (2, 1).

Therefore, the optimal next move is (2, 1)."

  - Row 2: 0 + 1 - 1 = 0
  - Row 3: 1 + 0 - 1 = 0

  - Diagonal from top-right to bottom-left: -1 + 1 + 0 = 0

There are no winning conditions currently present.

Now, let's check if there are any near-win states:

- Rows:

  - Row 2: |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 (One empty cell)

- Diagonals:
  - Diagonal from top-left to bottom-right: |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 (One empty cell)
  - Diagonal from top-right to bottom-left: |-1 + 1 + 0| = 0 (Two empty cells)

As there is a near-win state in Row 1 and Column 1, we should prioritize blocking the opponent from winning. Therefore, the optimal move would be to mark the empty cell in Row 1 and Column 1, which is at position (1, 1).

Final representation after the optimal move:
