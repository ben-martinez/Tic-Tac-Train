Let's analyze the current state of the game:

The sequence of moves played so far is: [(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 1)].

We can represent this sequence on the 3x3 grid as follows:

```
  1   2   3
1 X |   | O
 ---+---+---
2 O | X | X
 ---+---+---
3   | O | X
```

Now, let's determine the near-win and win states for both players.

For Player 1 (X), the near-win and win states are as follows:
- Rows: None
- Columns: None
- Diagonals: None

For Player 2 (O), the near-win and win states are as follows:
- Rows: None
- Columns: (3, 3) is a near-win state with a value of 2. If Player 2 marks this cell, they will win.
- Diagonals: None

According to the priority of moves, if a player has a near-win state, they should play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win. If there is no such move, but the opponent has a near-win state, the player should block their win by playing their piece in the cell that would complete the opponent's near-win.

In our current state, Player 2 (O) has a near-win state in the third column. Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to block Player 2's near-win by playing in cell (1, 3).

The updated game state would be:

```
  1   2   3
1 X |   | O
 ---+---+---
2 O | X | X
 ---+---+---
3 X | O | X
```

So, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is (1, 3)."

c_{1,1}  c_{1,2}  c_{1,3}
   1         -1         X
   -1         X         O
   X          O         -

Now, let's evaluate the current state of the game:

1. Winning conditions:
- Rows:
c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + (-1) + X = X != +/- 3
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = (-1) + X + O = O != +/- 3
c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = X + O + 0 = X != +/- 3

- Columns:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 1 + (-1) + X = X != +/- 3
c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = (-1) + X + O = O != +/- 3
c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = X + O + 0 = X != +/- 3

- Diagonals:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + X + 0 = X != +/- 3
c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = X + X + O = X != +/- 3

2. Near-Win States:
There are no near-win states for the current player (Player 1).

Based on the current state, Player 1 does not have any winning moves or near-win states to exploit. So, Player 1 should focus on blocking any potential winning moves by Player 2.

Looking at the game board, Player 2 has a near-win state in the second row:
|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |-1 + X + O| = 2 and c_{2,1} = 0

To block Player 2 from winning, Player 1 should play in the empty cell in the second row, first column (2, 1).

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is (2, 1)."

  0 |  0 |  0
-------------
  X |  O |  X
-------------
  X |  O |  O

Explanation of the matrix representation:
- Player 1 (X) has marked cells at positions (1, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 3).
- Player 2 (O) has marked cells at positions (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3).
- The remaining cells are still empty (marked as 0).

Now, let's check for any possible near-win states for both players:

For Player 1 (X):
- Rows:
   (1, 1) + (1, 2) + (1, 3) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
   (2, 1) + (2, 2) + (2, 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
   (3, 1) + (3, 2) + (3, 3) = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1

- Columns:
   (1, 1) + (2, 1) + (3, 1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2
   (1, 2) + (2, 2) + (3, 2) = 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1
   (1, 3) + (2, 3) + (3, 3) = 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1

- Diagonals:
   (1, 1) + (2, 2) + (3, 3) = 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0
   (1, 3) + (2, 2) + (3, 1) = 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1

For Player 2 (O):
- Rows:
   (1, 1) + (1, 2) + (1, 3) = (-1) + 0 + 0 = -1
   (2, 1) + (2, 2) + (2, 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
   (3, 1) + (3, 2) + (3, 3) = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

- Columns:
   (1, 1) + (2, 1) + (3, 1) = (-1) + 0 + 0 = -1
   (1, 2) + (2, 2) + (3, 2) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
   (1, 3) + (2, 3) + (3, 3) = 0 + (-1) + (-1) = -2

- Diagonals:
   (1, 1) + (2, 2) + (3, 3) = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2
   (1, 3) + (2, 2) + (3, 1) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Based on the near-win states analysis, we can see that currently, there is no winning move for either player. However, Player 2 (O) has a near-win state in the diagonal where the sum is -2, and one of the cells is 0. To prevent Player 2 from winning, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to mark the remaining cell in that diagonal.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is to mark the cell (2, 2).

    1     |     -1    |     1
------------------------------
    0     |     1     |     0

Now, let's check if there are any winning conditions for either player:

- Rows:
```
  -1 + 1 + 0 = 0
   1 + (-1) + 1 = 1
   0 + 1 + 0 = 1
```

None of the row sums equal +/- 3, so there are no winning rows.

- Columns:
```
  -1 + 1 + 0 = 0
   1 + (-1) + 1 = 1
   0 + 1 + 0 = 1
```

None of the column sums equal +/- 3, so there are no winning columns.

- Diagonals:
```
  -1 + (-1) + 0 = -2
   0 + (-1) + 0 = -1
```

None of the diagonal sums equal +/- 3, so there are no winning diagonals.

Next, let's check if there are any near-win states for either player:

- Rows:
```
  | -1 + 1 + 0 | = | 1 | and one of -1, 1, 0 is 0
```

The row near-win state condition is not met.

- Columns:
```
  | -1 + 1 + 0 | = | 1 | and one of -1, 1, 0 is 0
```

The column near-win state condition is not met.

- Diagonals:
```
  |-1 + (-1) + 0| = |-2| and one of -1, -1, 0 is 0
```

The diagonal near-win state condition is not met.

Since there are no winning or near-win conditions, we need to evaluate the priority of moves. In order to play optimally, we will try to create a winning move if possible or block the opponent's near-win state.

From the current state, we can see that Player 1 has a potential winning move by marking the top-right cell. Player 1 can complete the rightmost column with their mark to win the game.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to mark the cell (1, 3).

The updated game state will be:
```
  c_{1,1}  |  c_{1,2}  |  c_{1,3}

According to the priority of moves, if it is your turn and there is a near-win state for you, play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win. In this case, there is a near-win state for Player 1 in the first row.

There are no near-win conditions for either player at the moment.

Since there are neither winning nor near-winning conditions, we need to play strategically.

Player 1's (X) turn:
Player 1 should try to create a winning condition.

One possible move for Player 1 is to place their mark on cell (2, 2) to have three ""X"" marks in the diagonal from the top-left to bottom-right:

1  X | O | O
  ---+---+---
2  O | X |

    - Diagonal 2: |O + X + O| = |-1 + 1 - 1| = 1 (near-win diagonal for Player 2)

Based on the priority of moves, we should first try to play a move that creates a winning condition. As there are no winning moves available, we should check for near-win conditions.

Player 1 can win if they mark the third cell in the near-win column in Column 2. So, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to play at (2, 2).

Based on the winning conditions, we can see that there are no winning moves available for either player.

Next, let's check for near-win states:

- Near-Win States:
   - Row 1: |-1 + (-1) + 0| = 2, and one of -1, -1 is 0 (the middle cell at (1, 2) is empty)
   - Row 2: |1 + 1 + 0| = 2, and one of 1, 1 is 0 (the third cell at (2, 2) is empty)
   - Row 3: |1 + 1 + (-1)| = 1, and one of 1, (-1) is 0 (the third cell at (3, 2) is empty)
   - Column 1: |-1 + 1 + 1| = 1, and one of -1, 1 is 0 (the third cell at (3, 1) is empty)
   - Column 2: |-1 + 1 + 1| = 1, and one of -1, 1 is 0 (the third cell at (1, 2) is empty)
   - Column 3: |1 + 1 + 0| = 2, and one of 1, 1 is 0 (the middle cell at (2, 3) is empty)
   - Diagonal 1: |-1 + 1 + 0| = 0, and one of -1, 1 is 0 (the middle cell at (2, 2) is empty)
   - Diagonal 2: |1 + 1 + (-1)| = 1, and one of 1, (-1) is 0 (the third cell at (3, 1) is empty)

Based on the near-win states, there is a near-win opportunity for Player 1 (X) in the following cells: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 2). 

To play optimally, we should prioritize the winning move. Thus, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is to play at the cell (1, 2).

- Player 1 (X) played at (3, 2)
- Player 2 (O) played at (2, 1)
- Player 1 (X) played at (1, 1)

From the above calculations, we can see that there are no winning conditions or near-win states currently in the game.

To play optimally based on the priority of moves (Rule 5), we need to see if we have any winning moves. In this case, we do not have any winning moves.

Therefore, we need to check if the opponent has any near-win states. Let's calculate the near-win states for the opponent (Player 2, O):

1. Rows:
- |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |(-1) + 0 + 1| = 2 --> near-win state
- |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + 0 + (-1)| = 1
- |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + X|

2. Columns:
- |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |(-1) + 0 + 0| = 1
- |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |0 + 0 + 1| = 1
- |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + (-1) + X|

3. Diagonals:
- |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 0 + X|
- |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 0 + 0| = 1

We can see that the opponent has a near-win state in the first row. To block their win, we need to play our piece in one of the empty cells in the first row, which are (1,1) and (1,2).

Therefore, the optimal next move would be to play at (1,1) or (1,2).

Here, X represents Player 1's moves (marked as 1) and O represents Player 2's moves (marked as -1). The empty cells are represented as 0.

Next, let's check for any near-win states. 

Checking rows:
- Row 1: |0 + 1 + 0| = 1, and one of the cells is empty (0)
- Row 2: |(-1) + 1 + (-1)| = 1, and one of the cells is empty (0)
- Row 3: The row is empty, so no near-win state in this row.

- Column 1: |0 + (-1) + 0| = 1, and one of the cells is empty (0)
- Column 2: |1 + 1 + (-1)| = 1, and one of the cells is empty (0)
- Column 3: The column is empty, so no near-win state in this column.

Checking diagonals:
- Diagonal from top left to bottom right: |0 + 1 + -| = 1, and one of the cells is empty (0)
- Diagonal from top right to bottom left: |0 + 1 + O| = 1, and one of the cells is empty (0)

Based on the current state and the near-win states, there is no immediate winning move for Player 1. 

Next, we need to check if there is a near-win state for Player 2 to block them. 

- No near-win states for Player 2.

Since there are no immediate winning or near-win states for either player, we need to consider our next move based on the provided priority of moves.

Priority of Moves:
1. Winning move
2. Block opponent's near-win move
3. Create near-win move

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 would be to create a near-win move.

- (1, 3)
- (3, 3)

  - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1
  - |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1
  - |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 0 + 1| = 1

- Columns:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 0 + 0| = 0
  - |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2
  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 0 + 1| = 1

- Diagonals:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + 1| = 2
  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1

Player 2 does not have a winning move, but we can see that there is a near-win state in the second column and the second diagonal. To prevent Player 2 from winning, Player 1 should play in either the second column or the second diagonal.

Based on the analysis, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) should be (2, 2) to block Player 2's near-win in the second column.

The updated game board representation after Player 1's move is as follows:

```
   1   2   3
1 [0][X][O]
2 [O][X][ ]
3 [ ][X][X]
```

Based on the current state of the game, let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Winning conditions:
   - Rows: None of the rows have a sum of +/- 3, so there are no winning moves in the rows.
   - Columns: None of the columns have a sum of +/- 3, so there are no winning moves in the columns.
   - Diagonals: None of the diagonals have a sum of +/- 3, so there are no winning moves in the diagonals.

2. Near-win states:
   - Rows:
     - Row 1: |1 + (-1) + 1| = 1, and one of the cells is empty; however, filling the empty cell does not create a winning condition for Player 1.
     - Row 2: |-1 + 1 + (-1)| = 1, and one of the cells is empty; however, filling the empty cell does not create a winning condition for Player 1.
     - Row 3: |1 + 0 + 0| = 1, and two cells are empty. Filling any of the empty cells will create a winning condition for Player 1. Therefore, this is the optimal move. (3, 2)

   - Columns:
     - Column 1: |1 + (-1) + 1| = 1, and one of the cells is empty; however, filling the empty cell does not create a winning condition for Player 1.
     - Column 2: |-1 + 1 + 0| = 0, and two cells are empty; however, filling any of the empty cells does not create a winning condition for Player 1.
     - Column 3: |1 + (-1) + 0| = 0, and two cells are empty; however, filling any of the empty cells does not create a winning condition for Player 1.

   - Diagonals:
     - Diagonal 1: |1 + 1 + 0| = 2, and one of the cells is empty; however, filling the empty cell does not create a winning condition for Player 1.
     - Diagonal 2: |-1 + 1 + 0| = 0, and two cells are empty; however, filling any of the empty cells does not create a winning condition for Player 1.

3. Priority of Moves:
   - Since there is a near-win state for Player 1 in Row 3, the optimal move is to fill one of the empty cells in that row to create a winning condition. Therefore, the optimal next move is (3, 2)."

2  | X | O |   |

Now, let's check if there are any winning conditions for either player:

Rows: 
`1 + 0 + (-1) = 0`
`1 + (-1) + 0 = 0`
`(-1) + 0 + 1 = 0`

Columns: 
`1 + 1 + (-1) = 1`
`0 + (-1) + 0 = -1`
`0 + 0 + 1 = 1`

Diagonals:
`1 + (-1) + 1 = 1`
`(-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -3`

There are no rows, columns, or diagonals with a sum of 3 or -3, so there is no winner yet.

Next, let's check if there are any near-win states for either player:

For Player 1 (X):
- Row near-win states: None
- Column near-win states: None
- Diagonal near-win states: None

For Player 2 (O):
- Row near-win states: None
- Column near-win states: None
- Diagonal near-win states: None

Since there are no near-win states for either player, we need to analyze the priority of moves.

Priority of Moves:
Player 1 (X) has no winning move available.
Player 2 (O) has no near-win state that can be blocked.

Based on the current game state, neither player has a direct winning move or a near-win state to block.

Now, we need to find an empty cell to play our move. The empty cell is at position (2, 2).

Therefore, the optimal next move is to play at cell (2, 2).

Now, let's evaluate the game board based on the winning conditions and near-win states.

1. Winning conditions:
- Rows:

2. Near-win states:
- Rows:
   |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + 0 + 0| = 1 > 2 (no near-win state)
   |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 0 <= 2 (near-win state)
   |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 1 + 0| = 0 <= 2 (near-win state)
- Columns:
   |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 0 + (-1)| = 1 > 2 (no near-win state)

   |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 0 <= 2 (near-win state)

Based on the evaluation, there is no winning move for Player 1 at the moment. However, there is a near-win state in the second row (|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = 0 <= 2). Player 1 can block Player 2's potential win by marking the third cell in the second row.

The optimal move for Player 1 is to play: (2, 1).

   - Column 2: |1 + 0 + 0| = 1. One of the cells is 0. Not a near-win state.
   - Column 3: |1 + 1 + 0| = 2. One of the cells is 0. Not a near-win state.

For Player 1 (X):
- Rows:
  - Row 1: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
  - Row 2: -1 + 1 + 0 = 0
  - Row 3: 1 + 0 + -1 = 0

- Columns:
  - Column 1: 0 + -1 + 1 = 0
  - Column 2: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
  - Column 3: 1 + 0 + -1 = 0

- Diagonals:
  - Diagonal 1: 0 + 1 + -1 = 0
  - Diagonal 2: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

There are no near-win states or winning conditions for Player 1 (X) currently.

For Player 2 (O):
- Rows:
  - Row 1: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

  - Diagonal 1: 0 + -1 + 1 = 0
  - Diagonal 2: 0 + -1 + 0 = -1

There are no near-win states or winning conditions for Player 2 (O) currently.

Based on the current state of the game, there are no immediate winning moves or near-win states for either player. Therefore, we need to prioritize blocking the opponent's potential win.

Player 1 (X) had the last turn, and there are no near-win states for them. Now, it's Player 2's turn. By analyzing the board, we can see that if Player 2 places their mark at position (3, 2), they will create a near-win state in Row 3. To block this potential win, Player 2 should play at position (3, 2).

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 2 (O) is (3, 2).

Here is the updated game board representation after Player 2's move:

0 + O + 0 = -1 (no near-win condition)

Based on the priority of moves, if there is a near-win state for the player, they should play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win.

In this case, Player 2 has a near-win condition in column 2 (with two ""O"" marks). So, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to block Player 2's win by placing their mark on cell (3, 2).

- No near-win state exists for either player.

Since there is no near-win state for either player, we can prioritize creating a winning condition. 

Considering the current state, the optimal move would be to place Player 1's (X) mark at position (2, 3). This move will create a winning condition for Player 1 in Row 2.

Based on the current game state, there are no winning moves available for either player. However, Player 2 (O) has a near-win state in the second column where c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 2. To block Player 2's potential win, Player 1 (X) should play at position (3, 2).

    1 [   |   | X ]
       -----------
    2 [   | O | X ]
       -----------
    3 [ O | X | O ]

Based on this representation, we can calculate the summations for each row, column, and diagonal equation:

- Rows:
  c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
  c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0

  c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1

Based on the winning conditions, none of the rows, columns, or diagonals have a summation of +/- 3, so neither player has won yet.

Next, we will check for near-win states.

- Near-Win States:
  There are no near-win states for either player in the current game state.

Now, let's evaluate the priority of moves:

1. If there is a winning move available for Player 1, they should play it.
2. If there is a near-win state for Player 1, they should play the move that will mark the third cell of the near-win.
3. If there is a near-win state for Player 2, Player 1 should block the win by playing their piece in the appropriate location.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, both players should try to create a win as fast as possible.

Based on the current game state, neither Player 1 nor Player 2 has a winning move available.

Let's check if there are any near-win states for Player 1 or Player 2:

- Neither Player 1 nor Player 2 has a near-win state.

Since neither Player 1 nor Player 2 has a winning move or a near-win state, we should follow rule 4 and try to create a win as fast as possible.

The optimal next move, based on the current state and the priority of moves, would be to play at cell (2, 1).

The updated game state will be:

       1   2   3

The game board representation after the given sequence of moves is as follows:

 X |   | X

Now, let's evaluate the game according to the rules:

1. Winning conditions:

- Rows:
    - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0
    - c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0 + (-1) + 0 = -1

    - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1

There are no winning conditions for either player based on the current state of the game.

2. Near-Win States:

- Rows:
    - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 2 (Not a near-win state)
    - |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + (-1) + 0| = 1
      - c_{2,1}, c_{2,2}, and c_{2,3} are all nonzero, so it's not a near-win state in rows.
    - |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 0 + 1| = 2 (Not a near-win state)

    - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 0 + 1| = 2 (Not a near-win state)

- Diagonals:
    - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + (-1) + 1| = 0
      - c_{1,1}, c_{2,2}, and c_{3,3} are all nonzero, so it's not a near-win state in diagonals.
    - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |(-1) + (-1) + 1| = 1
      - c_{1,3}, c_{2,2}, and c_{3,1} are all nonzero, so it's not a near-win state in diagonals.

There are no near-win states for either player based on the current state of the game.

3. Priority of Moves:
Based on rule 5, since there are no winning moves or near-win states for either player, the optimal move would be to choose an empty cell that does not provide an immediate advantage to the opponent.

In the current state, cell (3, 2) is the only empty cell. Therefore, the optimal next move would be to play at cell (3, 2).

There are no near-win states for either player.

Priority of Moves:

Based on the current board state, Player 1 (X) does not have a winning move. However, Player 2 (O) has a near-win state in the third row, where they only need one more move to win.

To block Player 2's win, the optimal move for Player 1 is to play in any of the empty cells in the third row. Let's choose (3, 1) as the optimal next move for Player 1 (X).

Updated Game Board:

Now, let's check if there is a winning move available for Player 1 (X):

For rows:
- c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
- c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = -1 + 1 + 0 = 0

- c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
- c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 0 + -1 = 0

- c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

There is no winning move available for Player 1 (X).

Now, let's check if there is a near-win state for Player 1 (X):

In this case, we are looking for a state where two marks align in a line and the third cell is empty.

For rows:
- |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 0 + 1| = 1 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0
- |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |-1 + 1 + 0| = 0 and none of the cells in the row are 0
- |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 0 + -1| = 0 and none of the cells in the row are 0

For columns:
- |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + -1 + 1| = 0 and none of the cells in the column are 0
- |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 and one of c_{1,2}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,2} is 0
- |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 0 + -1| = 0 and none of the cells in the column are 0

For diagonals:
- |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + -1| = 0 and none of the cells in the diagonal are 0
- |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 1 + 1| = 3 and none of the cells in the diagonal are 0

There is a near-win state available for Player 1 (X) in the second row, where |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = 1. The empty cell is at position (2, 2), so the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is (2, 2).

Based on the sequence of moves played so far: [(3, 1), (3, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2)], the game board can be represented as:

      0  |  1  |  -1
   ----------------
      1  |  0  |  0

I will now evaluate the state of potential win conditions, near-win states, and the priority of moves before determining the optimal next move.

Win conditions:
- Rows:
  - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1, not a win condition
  - c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0, not a win condition
  - c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1, not a win condition

  - c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2, not a win condition
  - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1, not a win condition

Near-win states:
- Rows:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + 1 + (-1)| = |1| = 1, not a near-win state
  - |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = |0| = 0, not a near-win state
  - |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 0 + 0| = |1| = 1, not a near-win state

  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 0 + 1| = |2| = 2, a near-win state
  - |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = |2| = 2, a near-win state
  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |-1 + (-1) + 0| = |-2| = 2, a near-win state

  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |-1 + 1 + 1| = |1| = 1, not a near-win state

Priority of moves:
- Since there are no winning moves available, I will check for a blocking move to prevent Player 2 from creating a near-win state.
- From the near-win states, the columns (1,2) and (1,3) can be blocked by Player 1's move.

Based on the above analysis, the optimal next move for Player 1 would be to place their mark in the cell (1,2)."

1 [ 0  X  O ]
2 [ O  X  X ]
3 [ O  O  0 ]

Here, Player 1 (X) has made moves at (3, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (1, 2). Player 2 (O) has made moves at (1, 3), (2, 3), and (3, 1).

Now, let's evaluate the state of the game:

- Winning conditions:
  - Rows:
    - Row 1: 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (No win)
    - Row 2: (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1 (No win)
    - Row 3: (-1) + (-1) + 0 = -2 (No win)
  - Columns:
    - Column 1: 0 + (-1) + (-1) = -2 (No win)
    - Column 2: 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1 (No win)
    - Column 3: (-1) + 1 + 0 = 0 (No win)
  - Diagonals:
    - Diagonal 1: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 (No win)
    - Diagonal 2: (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1 (No win)

- Near-Win States:
  - There are no near-win states for either player in the current state.

Since there are no winning moves or near-win states for either player, we need to evaluate the priority of moves based on the conditions stated in Rule 5.

According to Rule 5, if it is your turn and there is a near-win state for you, play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win. If there are no winning moves for either player, but your opponent has a near-win condition, block their win by playing your piece where they would play to get a win condition.

In the current state, neither player has a near-win condition. Therefore, we should prioritize creating a possible win by selecting a move that leads to a near-win state for us.

Based on the evaluation, the optimal next move is to play at cell (3, 3) to create a potential near-win state for Player 1 (X).

The updated game state after the optimal move is:

```
   1  2  3
1 [ 0  X  O ]
2 [ O  X  X ]
3 [ O  O  X ]

Now, let's evaluate the rows, columns, and diagonals to identify any near-win states.

Rows:
- Row 1: 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0 (not a near-win state)
- Row 2: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 (not a near-win state)
- Row 3: 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1 (not a near-win state)

Columns:
- Column 1: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 (not a near-win state)
- Column 2: (-1) + 0 + 0 = -1 (not a near-win state)
- Column 3: 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1 (not a near-win state)

Diagonals:
- Main diagonal: 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1 (not a near-win state)
- Anti-diagonal: 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 (not a near-win state)

Based on the current state, there are no near-win states for either player.

Let's check if there is a winning move for the current player (Player 1):

- Row 1: There is no winning move in this row.
- Row 2: There is no winning move in this row.
- Row 3: There is no winning move in this row.
- Column 1: There is no winning move in this column.
- Column 2: There is no winning move in this column.
- Column 3: There is no winning move in this column.
- Main diagonal: There is no winning move in the main diagonal.
- Anti-diagonal: There is no winning move in the anti-diagonal.

Since there are no near-win states and no winning moves for Player 1, the optimal move would be to block any potential winning move for Player 2.

Based on the current state, it seems that Player 2 might have a potential winning move by marking cell (2, 3). To block that move, Player 1 should mark cell (2, 3).

Thus, the optimal next move would be (2, 3).

Final representation of the game state:

```

2 [     | O | X ]
3 [     | O | O ]

Player 1 (X) has made the following moves: (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1).
Player 2 (O) has made the following moves: (3, 2), (3, 3).

Based on this information, let's update the game board representation:

   c_{1,1} |  c_{1,2} |  c_{1,3}
--------------------------
     0     |    0     |    1
--------------------------
     0     |    1     |    -1
--------------------------
     0     |    0     |    -1

Now, let's check if there are any winning conditions:

- Rows:
c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ ±3
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 ≠ ±3
c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1 ≠ ±3

- Columns:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 ≠ ±3
c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 ≠ ±3
c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1 ≠ ±3

- Diagonals:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 ≠ ±3
c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 ≠ ±3

No winning conditions have been met yet.

Now, let's check for near-win states. 

- Rows:
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 0 + 1| = 1 ≠ 2
|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 0 ≠ 2
|c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 0 + (-1)| = 1 ≠ 2

- Columns:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 0 + 0| = 0 ≠ 2
|c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 ≠ 2
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + (-1) + (-1)| = 1 ≠ 2

- Diagonals:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 0 ≠ 2
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2 = 2

There is a near-win state in the diagonal where |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2.

Based on the priority of moves, Player 1 (X) should play their piece in the remaining empty cell in the near-win state to block Player 2's potential win in the next move.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is (3, 1).

The game board representation after the given sequence of moves is as follows:

    X O O
    X O -
    X - -

Now, let's check for possible winning conditions:

- Rows:
  - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1 (no winning condition)
  - c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0 (no winning condition)
  - c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 (no winning condition)

- Columns:
  - c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (Player 1 has a winning condition)
  - c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = (-1) + (-1) + 0 = -2 (no winning condition)
  - c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + 0 + 0 = -1 (no winning condition)

- Diagonals:
  - c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0 (no winning condition)
  - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1 (no winning condition)

We can see that Player 1 has a winning condition in the first column.

Also, let's check for near-win states:

- Rows:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + (-1) + (-1)| = 1 (no near-win state)
  - |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |1 + (-1) + 0| = 0 (no near-win state)
  - |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 0 + 0| = 1 (no near-win state)

- Columns:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 1 + 1| = 3 (Player 1 has a near-win state)
  - |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |(-1) + (-1) + 0| = 2 (no near-win state)
  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 0 + 0| = 1 (no near-win state)

- Diagonals:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + (-1) + 0| = 0 (no near-win state)
  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |(-1) + (-1) + 1| = 1 (no near-win state)

From the priorities of moves rule, we can see that Player 1 has a winning move in the first column (marked in bold):

    X O O
    **X** O -
    **X** - -

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to play in the first cell of the second column, resulting in the following game board:

    X O O
    X O -
    X - -

The notation for the optimal move is (2, 1).

Based on the current game state, let's evaluate the winning and near-win conditions for both players:

Player 1 (X): 
- Rows: 
    - `c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 - 1 = 0` (No near-win)

    - `c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = -1 - 1 - 1 = -3` (No near-win)

Player 2 (O):

    - `c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 - 1 = 0` (No near-win)
    - `c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1` (No near-win)

Neither player has a winning move available currently.

Since Player 1 (X) doesn't have a winning move, we need to check if there is a near-win condition for Player 2 (O) that needs to be blocked.

From the evaluation, we can see that there is a near-win condition for Player 2 (O) in the second column. The absolute value of the sum of the second column is 0, indicating a near-win condition, and the third cell in that column is empty.

Therefore, the optimal next move would be to block Player 2's (O's) near-win condition by placing an X in the third cell of the second column.

There is no near-win state for either player as well.

Since there is no winning or near-win condition, we need to prioritize blocking the opponent's potential winning moves.

Based on the current board state, the opponent (Player 2) has no near-win or winning moves. Therefore, as Player 1, my move should aim to create a near-win or winning condition.

To do so, I will play in the remaining empty cell in row 1, column 3. 

The optimal next move is (1, 3).

1. If there is a near-win state for Player 1, play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win.

2. If there is no winning move for Player 1, but Player 2 has a near-win condition, block their win by playing your piece to where they would play to get a win condition.

3. Try to create a win as fast as possible.

From the current game state, there is no near-win condition for Player 1 or Player 2. Therefore, we need to evaluate the priority of moves for the next optimal move.

Considering the game so far, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) is to play at position (3, 2) to create a near-win state in row 3:

c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 3
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 2
c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 1

Using the given sequence of moves, we can update the matrix notation accordingly:

```

          O(3,1)      X(3,2)     O(3,3)

Now, let's check for any win conditions:

- Rows:
  - `c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + X(1,3) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`
  - `c_{2,1} + O(2,2) + X(2,3) = 0 - 1 + 1 = 0`

  - `X(1,3) + O(2,2) + O(3,1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1`

No win conditions are satisfied at the moment.

Next, we need to check for any near-win conditions:

- Rows:
  - `|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + X(1,3)| = |1 + 0 + 1| = |2| = 2`, but all cells in this row are occupied, so no near-win condition.

- Columns:
  - `|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + O(3,1)| = |1 + 0 - 1| = |0| = 0`, but all cells in this column are occupied, so no near-win condition.

- Diagonals:
  - `|c_{1,1} + O(2,2) + O(3,3)| = |1 - 1 - 1| = |-1| = 1`, but all cells in this diagonal are occupied, so no near-win condition.
  - `|X(1,3) + O(2,2) + O(3,1)| = |1 - 1 - 1| = |-1| = 1`, but all cells in this diagonal are occupied, so no near-win condition.

Since there are no win conditions or near-win conditions, we move on to the priority of moves.

Player 1 (X) does not have any winning moves or near-win states, but Player 2 (O) can block a win by playing in one particular cell.

Since the current state of the game board is:

```
          c_{1,1}     c_{1,2}     X(1,3)
          c_{2,1}     O(2,2)     X(2,3)
          O(3,1)      X(3,2)     O(3,3)

Player 2 (O) has a near-win condition in the diagonal `c_{1,3} + O(2,2) + O(3,1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1` where `c_{1,3}` is 0. So, to block Player 2's win, Player 1 (X) needs to play in cell (1, 3):

```
          c_{1,1}     c_{1,2}     X(1,3)

   - |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = |2| = 2 (not a near-win state)

Based on the evaluation, there is no winning move for Player 1. However, there is a near-win state in the third column:

```
[  0   1   0  ]
[  0   1  -1  ]
[  1   0  -1  ]

The sequence of moves played so far:
1. Player 1 (X) marked cell (2, 3).
2. Player 2 (O) marked cell (1, 1).
3. Player 1 (X) marked cell (3, 1).
4. Player 2 (O) marked cell (3, 2).
5. Player 1 (X) marked cell (2, 1).
6. Player 2 (O) marked cell (1, 2).
7. Player 1 (X) marked cell (3, 3).

Now let's represent this game state in matrix form:

```
[-1, 0, 0]
[1, -1, 0]
[1, 0, 1]

Next, let's check if there are any winning conditions:

- Rows:
    - Row 1: -1 + 0 + 0 = -1 ≠ ±3
    - Row 2: 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0 ≠ ±3
    - Row 3: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 ≠ ±3
- Columns:
    - Column 1: -1 + 1 + 1 = 1 ≠ ±3
    - Column 2: 0 + (-1) + 0 = -1 ≠ ±3
    - Column 3: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ ±3
- Diagonals:
    - Diagonal from top-left to bottom-right: -1 + (-1) + 1 = -1 ≠ ±3
    - Diagonal from top-right to bottom-left: 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0 ≠ ±3

There are no winning conditions yet.

Next, let's check if there are any near-win states for either player:

- Rows:
    - Row 1: |-1 + 0 + 0| = 1 ≠ 2, and one of -1, 0, 0 is 0
    - There is a near-win state for Player 2 in Row 1.
- Columns:
    - Column 1: |-1 + 1 + 1| = 1 ≠ 2, and one of -1, 1, 1 is 0
    - There is a near-win state for Player 2 in Column 1.
- Diagonals: (None)

Based on the near-win states for Player 2, we need to block their win.

The optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to mark the empty cell in either Row 1 or Column 1.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is to mark cell (1, 3).

The updated game state after this move is:

No near-win states are present on the game board.

Next, we need to check if there is a winning move for Player 1 (X):

Near-win states for Player 1 (X):

    No other near-win states for Player 2.

Based on the current game state, there are no near-win states for either player. Now, we can apply the priority of moves rule.

Since there are no near-win states for either player, we need to analyze the board and blocks any potential win for Player 1 (X).

Based on the available near-win states, neither player has a move that will result in an immediate win.

To play optimally, since it is Player 1's turn, we need to see if there is a move that can create a near-win state for Player 1. In this case, there is no such move.

Next, we need to check if there is a move that can block a near-win state for Player 2. Based on the near-win states mentioned above, Player 2 can potentially win by marking cell (1,1) or (3,3).

  - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = X + O + O = 1
  - c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = O + X + X = 0
  - c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + X + 0 = X

- Columns:
  - c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = X + O + X = 0
  - c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = O + X + X = 0
  - c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = O + X + 0 = 0

- Diagonals:
  - c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = X + X + 0 = 0
  - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = O + X + O = 0

Based on the current state, there are no winning conditions for either player. Now let's check for near-win states:

- Rows:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |X + O + O| = 1 (no near-win)
  - |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |O + X + X| = 1 (no near-win)
  - |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + X + 0| = 1 (no near-win)

- Columns:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |X + O + 0| = 1 (no near-win)
  - |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |O + X + X| = 1 (no near-win)
  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |O + X + 0| = 1 (no near-win)

- Diagonals:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |X + X + 0| = 0 (near-win for Player 1)
  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |O + X + O| = 1 (no near-win)

From the evaluation, we can see that there is a near-win for Player 1 on the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right, and there are no near-win conditions for Player 2.

Given the priority of moves mentioned in the rules, Player 1 should play the move that marks the third cell in the near-win condition. In this case, Player 1 should play at position (3, 3) to win the game.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is (3, 3)."

Current game state:
```
   |   |   
-----------
   | X | O
-----------
 O |   | X
```

Calculating the sum for each row:
```
0 + 0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 + 0 = 1
-1 + 0 + 1 = 0
```

Calculating the sum for each column:
```
0 + 0 + -1 = -1
0 + 1 + 0 = 1
0 + 0 + 1 = 1
```

Calculating the sum for each diagonal:
```
0 + 1 + 1 = 2
-1 + 1 + 0 = 0
```

Based on the current game state, there are no near-win or winning conditions for either player. 

To play optimally, we need to prioritize creating a near-win or blocking the opponent's near-win. Since there is no near-win state for either player, we will focus on finding the optimal move to block the opponent's potential win.

Based on the current game state, the opponent (Player 2) has a near-win condition in the third row. To block their win, we need to place our mark (Player 1 - X) in the third empty cell of that row, which is at position (3, 2).

Therefore, the optimal next move is (3, 2)."

c_{1,1} = 0, c_{1,2} = 0, c_{1,3} = 1
c_{2,1} = -1, c_{2,2} = 1, c_{2,3} = 0
c_{3,1} = 0, c_{3,2} = -1, c_{3,3} = 0

Now let's check for any winning conditions or near-win states:

- Rows:
c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 (no win or near-win)
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = -1 + 1 + 0 = 0 (no win or near-win)
c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + (-1) + 0 = -1 (no win or near-win)

- Columns:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 0 + (-1) + 0 = -1 (no win or near-win)
c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (no win or near-win)
c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 (no win or near-win)

- Diagonals:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 (no win or near-win)
c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 (no win or near-win)

Now, let's reason with the priority of moves. Since we don't have a winning move and there are no near-win conditions for us, we need to consider blocking our opponent from winning.

Looking at the current state, we see that if player 2 (O) marks cell (1, 2), they would create a row win. Therefore, our optimal move would be to play at cell (1, 2) and mark it with X.

Final game board representation:

c_{1,1} = 0, c_{1,2} = 1, c_{1,3} = 1
c_{2,1} = -1, c_{2,2} = 1, c_{2,3} = 0
c_{3,1} = 0, c_{3,2} = -1, c_{3,3} = 0

The given sequence of moves played so far is:
[(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 2)]

Let's represent this sequence on a 3x3 grid:

    |   | X
 ---+---+---
    | O | O
 ---+---+---
  X |   |

Now let's check for any winning conditions:

- Rows:

   c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = -1 + 0 + -1 = -2 (No win)
   c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 (No win)

- Columns:

   c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 (No win)

   c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 (No win)

Based on the current state, there are no winning conditions for either player.

Next, let's check for any near-win conditions:

|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 0 + 1| = 2 (No near-win)

There are no near-win conditions for either player.

Since there are no winning or near-win conditions for either player, we need to prioritize creating a win condition or blocking the opponent's winning move.

In this case, there are no immediate winning moves available. However, we can block the opponent's potential winning move by placing our piece in the cell (1, 1) to prevent them from getting a diagonal win in the next move.

Therefore, the optimal next move is (1, 1).

Now, let's check if there are any winning conditions for either player.

Checking rows:
- Row 1: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, not a winning condition.
- Row 2: 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0, not a winning condition.
- Row 3: 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0, not a winning condition.

Checking columns:
- Column 1: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, not a winning condition.
- Column 2: 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0, not a winning condition.
- Column 3: 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0, not a winning condition.

Checking diagonals:
- Diagonal 1: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2, not a winning or near-win condition.
- Diagonal 2: 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0, not a winning condition.

Next, let's check if there are any near-win states for either player.

Checking rows:
- Row 1: |0 + 0 + 0| = 0, not a near-win condition.
- Row 2: |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 0, not a near-win condition.
- Row 3: |0 + (-1) + 1| = 0, not a near-win condition.

Checking columns:

- Column 2: |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 0, not a near-win condition.
- Column 3: |0 + (-1) + 1| = 0, not a near-win condition.

Checking diagonals:
- Diagonal 1: |0 + 1 + 1| = 2, not a near-win condition.
- Diagonal 2: |0 + (-1) + 1| = 0, not a near-win condition.

Since there are no winning or near-win conditions for either player, it is not possible to end the game in the next move. Therefore, the optimal next move would be based on the priority of moves.

As Player 1, if there are no winning moves or near-win conditions, the next best move is to block the opponent's near-win condition. Looking at the current game board, we can see that Player 2 has a near-win state on the second column.

To block Player 2's near-win, the optimal next move for Player 1 would be to play at (1, 2).

  - Diagonal from top right to bottom left: 0 + (-1) + (-1) = -2

Now, let's check if there are any near-win states for either player:

- There is no near-win state for Player 1 (X) since no two marks are in a line.

- There is no near-win state for Player 2 (O) since no two marks are in a line.

Based on the current state of the game, neither player has a winning move or a near-win state. Therefore, we need to reason with the priority of moves to make the optimal next move.

Priority of Moves:
1. If you have a winning move, play it.
2. If your opponent has a near-win state, block their win.
3. Try to create a win as fast as possible.

Since none of the players have a winning move or a near-win state, we need to find the best available move to maximize the chances of winning.

The available empty cells are (1, 2) and (2, 2). Based on the current state, I would recommend choosing (1, 2) as the optimal next move.

Now let's check if there is a near-win state for either player:

There are no near-win states for either player since no row, column, or diagonal has two marks of either player, with the third cell empty.

Since there are no near-win states for Player 1 and Player 2, we need to evaluate if there is a winning move. Checking the sums once again, we see that:

- There is no row with a sum of 3 or -3, so Player 1 does not have a winning move in a row.
- There is no column with a sum of 3 or -3, so Player 1 does not have a winning move in a column.
- There is no diagonal with a sum of 3 or -3, so Player 1 does not have a winning move in a diagonal.

Now, it is Player 2's turn. We will check if there is a winning move for Player 2. Checking the sums, we find that:

- There is no row with a sum of 3 or -3, so Player 2 does not have a winning move in a row.
- There is no column with a sum of 3 or -3, so Player 2 does not have a winning move in a column.
- There is no diagonal with a sum of 3 or -3, so Player 2 does not have a winning move in a diagonal.

Since there is no winning move for either player, we need to evaluate the priority of moves. In this case, we do not have a winning move and there are no near-win states, so we have to make a move that prevents our opponent from winning.

The optimal move for Player 1 is to play at cell (3, 3), marking it with an X.

Based on the current game board, there are no winning conditions or near-win states. 

To play optimally, we need to check if there are any winning moves we can make. If not, we check if our opponent has a near-win state and block it. Lastly, we can try to create our own near-win state.

In this case, we don't have any winning moves or near-win states available. 

Therefore, we need to play a move that strategically blocks our opponent and prevents them from winning. 

Looking at the current game board, the only available empty cell is at position (3, 3). 

Therefore, the optimal next move is to play at position (3, 3).

          |   | O
        --------
          | X |
        --------
          X | O |

We can write this representation as a matrix where X = 1, O = -1, and empty cells = 0:

        [0, 0, -1]
        [0, 1, 0]
        [1, -1, 0]

Now let's evaluate the game state:

1. Winning conditions: 

- Rows: 
  c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1 ==> Not a winning condition
  c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 ==> Not a winning condition
  c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0 ==> Not a winning condition

- Columns: 
  c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ==> Not a winning condition
  c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 ==> Not a winning condition
  c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + 0 + 0 = -1 ==> Not a winning condition

- Diagonals: 
  c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 ==> Not a winning condition
  c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1 ==> Not a winning condition

There are no winning conditions for either player.

2. Near-Win States:
There are no near-win states for either player.

Since there are no winning or near-win states for either player, we need to consider the priority of moves.

Priority of Moves:
If it is your turn and there is a near-win state for you, play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win. 
If it is your turn and you have no move that creates a winning condition, but your opponent has a near-win condition, 
block their win by playing your piece where they would play to get a win condition.

Based on the current state, there are no near-win states for either player. Therefore, we need to consider other strategies.

To create a win as fast as possible, I will choose to mark the empty cell in the center of the game board. 

The optimal next move is to mark the cell (2, 2) with X:

          |   | O
        --------
          | X |
        --------

Based on the current game state, there are no winning or near-win conditions for either player. 

Since it is my turn, I will play optimally by selecting the move that potentially leads to a near-win or blocks the opponent's near-win. In this case, all cells are still empty. Therefore, any of the remaining cells is a valid move.

   As there are no winning moves or near-win states for Player 1, we need to check if there are any near-win states for Player 2.

   None of the states in the game board provide a near-win condition for Player 2.

Therefore, since there are no near-win states for Player 2, Player 1 should play the next move according to their strategy to create a winning condition as fast as possible.

From the near-win states, we can see that there are multiple potential winning moves for Player 1 (X). Player 1 should prioritize making a winning move if possible.

Based on the evaluation, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) should be to place their mark in the empty cell at (2, 1).

- c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1

There are no winning conditions for either player at the moment.

Using the rules provided, let's evaluate the game board:

Rows:
c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + 1 + 0 = 0

Columns:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1
c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + 0 + 0 = -1

Diagonals:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + 1 + 0 = 0

Based on the evaluation, we don't have any winning conditions yet. Now, let's check for near-win states:

Near-Win States:
- Rows:
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 2
|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1
|c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 1 + 0| = 0

- Columns:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 0 + (-1)| = 1
|c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 0 + 0| = 1

- Diagonals:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |(-1) + 1 + 0| = 0

Based on the near-win states evaluation, we have:

- A near-win state in the second row, where the third cell is empty (Position 2, 3).
- A near-win state in the second column, where the third cell is empty (Position 3, 3).
- A near-win state in the right diagonal, where the third cell is empty (Position 1, 1).

According to the priority of moves rule, if there is a near-win state, we should play the move that marks the third empty cell in the near-win condition.

Therefore, the optimal next move is to play at position (2, 3) to complete the near-win state in the second row.

Updated game board with the optimal move:

     1    2    3

Now, let's evaluate the game board according to the winning and near-win conditions:

Rows:
- c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
- c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = -1 + 1 + -1 = -1
- c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 0 + -1 = 0

Columns:
- c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 0 + -1 + 1 = 0
- c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
- c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 1 + -1 + -1 = -1

Diagonals:
- c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + -1 = 0
- c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Based on the evaluations, there is no winning move for Player 1 (X) or Player 2 (O). However, there is a near-win state for Player 2 (O) on diagonal c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} since |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 1 + 1| = 3. To block Player 2's potential win, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to place their mark at (3, 2).

To determine the optimal next move, let's represent the current game state on the 3x3 grid:

1  0  -1
0  -1  1
0  1   -1

Now, let's check for any winning conditions or near-win states.

Winning conditions:
- No player has three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

Near-win states:
- Rows:
  - |1 + 0 - 1| = 2 and one of 1, 0, -1 is 0. Not a near-win state.
  - |0 - 1 + 1| = 2 and one of 0, -1, 1 is 0. Not a near-win state.
  - |0 + 1 - 1| = 2 and one of 0, 1, -1 is 0. Not a near-win state.
- Columns:
  - |1 + 0 + 0| = 1 and one of 1, 0, 0 is 0. Not a near-win state.
  - |0 - 1 + 1| = 1 and one of 0, -1, 1 is 0. Not a near-win state.
  - |1 + 1 - 1| = 1 and one of 1, 1, -1 is 0. Not a near-win state.
- Diagonals:
  - |1 - 1 - 1| = 1 and one of 1, -1, -1 is 0. Not a near-win state.
  - |0 - 1 + 0| = 1 and one of 0, -1, 0 is 0. Not a near-win state.

Since there are no winning conditions or near-win states, we need to consider the priority of moves.

Priority of Moves:
1. If it is your turn and there is a near-win state for you, play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win.
2. If it is your turn and you have no move that creates a winning condition, but your opponent has a near-win condition, block their win by playing your piece where they would play to get a win condition.
3. Try to create a win as fast as possible.

Based on the current game state, there are no near-win states or winning moves available. Therefore, we need to apply strategy 2 and block the opponent's potential winning move.

Looking at the sequence of moves played so far, the opponent's next move would be to mark (3, 2) to create a winning condition in the third column.

To block their win, the optimal next move would be (3, 2).

Therefore, the optimal next move is (3, 2)."

|     |  O |  X  |

Now, let's evaluate the current state of the game board according to the winning conditions and near-win states. 

Winning conditions:
- Rows:

Based on the above evaluations, we can see that there are no winning moves or near-win states for either player.

To determine the optimal next move, we can see if there are any moves that would lead to a near-win state for Player 1. In this case, there are no such moves.

Next, we need to check if there are any moves that would block a potential win for Player 2. Looking at the board, we can see that if Player 1 marks cell (2,1), it"

  - Diagonal 2 (top-right to bottom-left): |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 (one of c_{1,3}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,1} is 0)

From the evaluations above, we can see that there is a near-win state for Player 1 in Row 2, Column 3, and Diagonal 1. However, Row 2 has the highest priority since it has a near-win state with a |2| value.

To play optimally, the optimal move for Player 1 would be to mark the empty cell in Row 2. Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 would be (2, 1).

Near-win states for Player 2 (O):
- Rows: None

Since there are no near-win states for either player, we need to determine the optimal move using the priority of moves rule.

Priority of Moves:
1. If there is a winning move available, play it.
2. If there is no winning move, but the opponent has a near-win state, block it.
3. Otherwise, make any valid move.

Based on the current game state, there are no winning moves available for either player.

Now, let's check if the opponent (Player 2) has any near-win states:

Near-win states for Player 2 (O):
- Rows: None
- Columns: None
- Diagonals: None

Since there are no near-win states for Player 2, we can proceed to make any valid move.

The available empty cells are:

```
[     |     |   ]
[  O  |  X  | O ]
[X | O | X ]

Thus, the optimal next move would be to mark the cell (3, 1) to block the potential winning move for Player 1.

The sequence of moves played so far is as follows:

1. Player 1 (X) marked cell (2, 3).
2. Player 2 (O) marked cell (1, 1).
3. Player 1 (X) marked cell (2, 2).
4. Player 2 (O) marked cell (2, 1).
5. Player 1 (X) marked cell (3, 2).
6. Player 2 (O) marked cell (1, 3).
7. Player 1 (X) marked cell (3, 3).

Based on this sequence, we can update the game board representation:

```
[ 0 -1  1 ]
[ 0  1 -1 ]
[ 0  0  1 ]
```

Now, let's check if there are any near-win states or winning conditions for either player:

Near-win states for Player 1 (X):
- None

Near-win states for Player 2 (O):
- Top row: |0 + (-1) + 1| = 2 and c_{1,1} = 0 (Third cell is empty)

Winning conditions for Player 1 (X):
- Diagonal: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

Winning conditions for Player 2 (O):
- None

Since there is a near-win state for Player 2 (O) in the top row, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to block Player 2's win by marking the empty cell in the top row, which is (1, 2).

The updated game board representation after Player 1's move:

```
[ 0 -1  1 ]
[ 0  1 -1 ]
[ 0  1  1 ]
```

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is (1, 2)."

     c_{1,1}  c_{1,2}  c_{1,3}
     c_{2,1}  c_{2,2}  c_{2,3}
     c_{3,1}  c_{3,2}  c_{3,3}

After the given sequence of moves, the game board is:

     c_{2,1}   X       O
     c_{3,1}   O       O

Now, I will evaluate the current state and determine the optimal next move.

First, let's check for any near-win states:

- No near-win states for Player 1 (X) because there are no two marks in a line for Player 1.

- No near-win states for Player 2 (O) because there are no two marks in a line for Player 2.

Since there are no near-win states for either player, we will consider the next best move according to the priority of moves:

Player 1 (X) does not have a winning move in the current state. But Player 2 (O) has a near-win state in the second column. If Player 2 marks the cell (3, 2) with an 'O', they will win the game.

To block Player 2's win, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) is to mark the empty cell (3, 2).

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is (3, 2)."

Now, let's evaluate the game board based on the rules provided.

1. Winning conditions:
   - Rows:
     - Row 1: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
     - Row 2: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

     - Diagonal 1 (top-left to bottom-right): 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
     - Diagonal 2 (top-right to bottom-left): (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2

2. Near-Win States:
   - Row 1: |1 + (-1) + (-1)| = 1
   - Row 2: |1 + 0 + 1| = 2

   - Diagonal 1: |1 + 0 + 0| = 1
   - Diagonal 2: |(-1) + 0 + (-1)| = 2

Based on the evaluation, neither player has a winning move.
However, we can see that there is a near-win state for Player 1 in Row 2. By placing their mark in cell (2, 2), Player 1 can complete the row and win the game.

First, let's represent the game board after the given sequence of moves:

1 | X | X | O |
   ------------
2 |   |   | O |

Now, let's check if there are any winning conditions for either player:

- Rows:
    - `c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1` (not a win)
    - `c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0` (not a win)

    - `c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2` (not a win)

Since there is no winning condition for any player, let's check for near-win states:

- Rows:
    - `|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2` (not a near-win)
    - `|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + 0 + 1| = 1` (not a near-win)
    - `|c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 0 + 1| = 0` (not a near-win)

- Columns:
    - `|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 0 + (-1)| = 0` (not a near-win)

    - `|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |(-1) + 0 + (-1)| = 2` (not a near-win)

Since there is no near-win state for any player, we need to determine the optimal move based on the priority of moves.

Player 1's (X) turn:
Player 1 currently has no winning move.

Now, let's consider Player 2's (O) moves:
- There is a near-win state in the first column: `|c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = 1`. If Player 2 plays in the second row (2, 2), they will win.

To block Player 2's win, Player 1 should play in the second row (2, 2).

Therefore, the optimal next move is (2, 2).

3 [ O , X , O ]

Next, let's check if there are any win conditions or near-win states for either player.

Win conditions:
- No player has three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

Near-win states:

- Rows:
  - Row 1: | -1 + (-1) + 1 | = 1, and one of -1, -1, 1 is 0 (near-win state for Player 1)

  - Diagonal 2: | 1 + 0 + 1 | = 2, and one of 1, 0, 1 is 0

Based on the stored game state, there are near-win states for Player 1 in row 1 and row 3. Since Player 1 has the priority to play the optimal move, they should choose the move that completes the near-win state in row 1 or row 3.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to mark the cell (1, 2)."

2. Near-win states:
   No near-win states for either player.

   - Diagonal 1: 0 + 0 + (-1) = -1
   - Diagonal 2: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Based on the current state of the game, no player has a winning condition.

Next, let's check if there are any near-win states for either player:

- Rows:
   - Row 1: |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 and one of 0, 1, 0 is 0
   - Row 2: |1 + 0 + (-1)| = 2 and one of 1, 0, -1 is 0

   - Diagonal 2: |0 + 0 + 0| = 0 and one of 0, 0, 0 is 0

Based on the current state of the game, there are no near-win states for either player.

Since there are no winning or near-win states for either player at the moment, we must reason with rule 5. The priority of moves is to play a winning move if available, and if not, block the opponent's near-win condition.

After evaluating the current state of the game, we can see that there are no immediate winning moves for either player. However, player 1 has a potential winning move by marking cell (0, 2) and creating a near-win state on Row 1. Therefore, the optimal next move for player 1 is to mark cell (0, 2).

  c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = -1 + 1 + -1 = -1
  c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1

- Columns:

There are no winning states at the moment. Let's check for near-win states:

- Rows:
  |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 0 + 1| = 1 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0 (near-win state)
  Other rows do not have near-win states.

- Columns:
  |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + -1 + 0| = 1 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{2,1}, c_{3,1} is 0 (near-win state)

Based on the priority of moves, we need to check if there is a winning move for the current player (Player 1) or if the opponent (Player 2) has a near-win state to block.

Since there are no winning moves available for Player 1, let's check if Player 2 has a near-win state. From the evaluation above, we can see that Player 2 has a near-win state in the second row (c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = -1 + 1 + -1 = -1), where one of the cells is empty (c_{2,1} = 0). 

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to play in the cell (2, 1) to block Player 2's potential win.

The updated game board representation after the optimal move is as follows:
