c_{2,2} = 1
c_{2,3} = 1
c_{3,1} = 1
c_{3,2} = -1
c_{3,3} = -1

Next, let's check for any winning conditions:

- Rows:
c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (not a win)
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1 (not a win)
c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1 (not a win)

- Columns:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0 (not a win)
c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1 (not a win)
c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1 (not a win)

- Diagonals:

c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1 (not a win)

There are no winning conditions present at the moment.

Now let's check for any near-win states:

- Rows:
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 2 (not a near-win)
Similar for other rows.

- Columns:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + (-1) + 1| = 2 (near-win for Player 1)
Similar for other columns.

- Diagonals:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 2 (not a near-win)
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |(-1) + 1 + 1| = 1 (not a near-win)

Player 1 has a near-win state in the first column.

According to Rule 5, if there is a near-win state for you, play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win. Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) is (3, 1) to complete the near-win in the first column.

Now let's evaluate the current game board to determine the optimal move:

- Winning Conditions:
    - There are no winning conditions for either player. 

- Near-Win Conditions:
    - Rows:
        - No near-win state in rows.
    - Columns:
        - No near-win state in columns.
    - Diagonals:
        - No near-win state in diagonals.

Since there are no near-win states or winning conditions for either player, we need to determine the optimal move by reasoning with rule 5, the Priority of Moves. 

According to rule 5, as Player 1, we should try to create a winning move as fast as possible. 

Given the current game board, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to place their mark in the third cell of the first row (c_{1,2}). 

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is to play at position (1, 2)."

Next, let's calculate the sum of each row, column, and diagonal:

- Rows:
c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = -1 + (-1) + 1 = -1
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0
c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

- Columns:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0

- Diagonals:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

Based on the current state, there is no immediate winning move for Player 1. However, we can check for near-win states:

- Rows:
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |-1 + (-1) + 1| = 1
|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = 0
|c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 1 + 1| = 3

- Columns:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |-1 + 0 + 1| = 0
|c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |-1 + 0 + 1| = 0
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 0 + (-1)| = 0

- Diagonals:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |-1 + 0 + 1| = 0
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 0 + 1| = 2

From the above calculations, we see that there is a near-win state in the third row, and the third cell in that row is empty. Player 1 should play in that cell (3, 2) to win the game.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is (3, 2).

Note: If there were no near-win states for Player 1, the next step would be to check if Player 2 has any near-win states and block their win by playing in the cell that would complete the near-win state."

- Diagonals:
    - Main diagonal: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
    - Anti-diagonal: -1 + 1 + (-1) = -1

There are no winning conditions yet, so we need to check for near-win states.

- Near-Win States:

    - Row 2: |(-1) + 1 + 0| = 2 and one of (-1), 1, 0 is 0 (cell (2, 3))

Based on the near-win states, we see that there is an opportunity for Player 1 (X) to win by marking the third cell in the near-win state in row 3 (cell (3, 2)). Therefore, Player 1 should play the move (3, 2) to win the game.

Final game state:

Winning conditions:
- Rows:
  - `1 + (-1) + 1 = 1` (not a winning condition)
  - `(-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1` (not a winning condition)
  - `(-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1` (not a winning condition)
- Columns:

- Diagonals:
  - `1 + 1 + 0 = 2` (not a winning condition)
  - `X + (-1) + O = 0` (not a winning condition)

Near-win states:
- Rows:
  - `|1 + (-1) + 0| = 0` (not a near-win state)
  - `|(-1) + 1 + (-1)| = 1` (not a near-win state)
  - `|(-1) + 1 + 0| = 1` (not a near-win state)
- Columns:

Based on the analysis, we can see that Player 1 has two near-win states with the third cell at (3, 3) in both the column and diagonal. Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to play at cell (3, 3).

c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0 - 1 + 1 = 0

c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1

Based on the current state of the game, no player has a near-win or winning condition. 

To play optimally according to the priority of moves, we need to consider if there are any near-win states for us. Since there are no near-win states for us, we need to check if our opponent has a near-win state.

Looking at the board, we notice that if we place our mark in cell (2, 2), it will block a potential near-win for our opponent in the middle column. 

Therefore, the optimal next move is (2, 2).

- Near-Win state for Player 2 in column 2: |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |0 + (-1) + 1| = 2, and c_{1,2} = 0

Based on the priority of moves, since Player 1 does not have a near-win state, but Player 2 does in column 2, the optimal move for Player 1 would be to block Player 2's potential win in column 2.

Based on the near-win states, Player 1 (X) has the opportunity to win the game by marking the third cell in either Row 1 or Column 3.

Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to mark the empty cell in either Row 1 or Column 3. Let's denote this move as (1, 2) or (3, 3).

- Winning conditions:

- Near-win states:

- In the first row, the near-win state is `(1, 2)`, where the sum of the first and second cells is 2, and the third cell is empty.
- In the second row, no near-win state exists.
- In the third row, the near-win state is `(3, 3)`, where the sum of the second and third cells is 2, and the first cell is empty.
- In the first column, no near-win state exists.
- In the second column, no near-win state exists.
- In the third column, no near-win state exists.
- In the main diagonal, no near-win state exists.
- In the anti-diagonal, no near-win state exists.

- Priority of moves:

Since neither player has a winning move, we need to prioritize creating a winning condition or blocking the opponent's near-win condition. In this case, there is a near-win state for Player 1 in the first row at position `(1, 2)`. Therefore, Player 1 should make the move `(1, 2)` to mark the third cell in the near-win state and potentially create a winning condition.

- Diagonal from top right to bottom left: |0 + -1 + 1| = 0 and one of 0, -1, 1 is 0 (not a near-win state)

From the near-win states analysis, we can see that there is a near-win state in the first row for Player 1 (X). The third cell in this near-win state is empty. Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 is to mark the empty cell in the first row.

Optimal next move: (1, 3)"

The current game state after the given sequence of moves is:

c_{1,1} = 0, c_{1,2} = 1, c_{1,3} = -1 
c_{2,1} = -1, c_{2,2} = 1, c_{2,3} = 1 
c_{3,1} = -1, c_{3,2} = 0, c_{3,3} = 1 

Now, let's check if there is a winning condition (three marks in a row, column, or diagonal) for any player. We will consider the rows, columns, and diagonals separately:

Rows:
c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (No winning condition)
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1 (No winning condition)
c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0 (No winning condition)

Columns:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 0 + (-1) + (-1) = -2 (No winning condition)
c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 (No winning condition)
c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1 (No winning condition)

Diagonals:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 (No winning condition)
c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1 (No winning condition)

Since there is no winning condition for any player, let's check if there is a near-win state. A near-win state is when a player has two marks in a line and the third cell is empty.

Rows:
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 2, and c_{1,1} = 0 (Near-win state for Player 1)
|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |(-1) + 1 + 1| = 1 (No near-win state)
|c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 0 + 1| = 2, and c_{3,2} = 0 (Near-win state for Player 2)

Columns:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + (-1) + (-1)| = 2, and c_{2,1} = 0 (Near-win state for Player 1)
|c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2, and c_{3,2} != 0 (No near-win state)
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 1 + 1| = 1 (No near-win state)

Diagonals:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + 1| = 2, and c_{3,3} = 0 (Near-win state for Player 1)
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |(-1) + 1 + (-1)| = 1 (No near-win state)

Based on the above analysis, Player 1 has two near-win states in the following cells: (1, 1), (2, 1), and (3, 3). To play optimally, Player 1 should choose one of these cells as the next move. 

Since the priority of moves is to create a win as fast as"

    - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + -1 + 1 = 1 (Not a winning condition)

Player 2 (O) has already won with a diagonal line. Therefore, Player 2 (O) has already won the game. No more moves are needed.

The optimal next move is not applicable in this scenario since the game has already been won by Player 2 (O)."

To find the optimal next move, we need to check for any winning conditions or near-win states for both players.

Player 1 (X) has no winning move at the moment.

Player 2 (O) has a near-win state in the third column:
| -1 + 0 + 1 | = 2 and one of c_{1,3}, c_{2,3}, c_{3,3} is 0.

2. Near-Win States:

None of the rows, columns, or diagonals have a near-win state.

3. Priority of Moves:

Player 1 (X) played the last move, so it is now Player 2's (O) turn.

Since Player 2 (O) doesn't have a winning move and there are no near-win states, Player 2 should aim to block Player 1 from winning.

The only potential winning move for Player 1 is to mark cell (2, 2). So, Player 2 should block this move by marking the same cell.

To determine the optimal next move, we need to check if there is a near-win state for either player that can lead to an immediate win. If there is no near-win state, we must prevent the opponent from winning in their next move.

1. Check for near-win state for Player 1 (X):
- Rows:

Based on the above analysis, Player 1 (X) does not have a near-win state.

Next, let's check for any near-win states for either player:

Rows:
- Row 1: |1 + (-1) + 1| = 1, no near-win state
- Row 2: |0 + (-1) + 1| = 0, no near-win state
- Row 3: |(-1) + 1 + 0| = 0, no near-win state

Columns:
- Column 1: |1 + 0 + (-1)| = 2, near-win state for Player 1 (X)
- Column 2: |(-1) + (-1) + 1| = 3, not a near-win state
- Column 3: |1 + 1 + 0| = 2, near-win state for Player 1 (X)

Diagonals:
- Diagonal 1: |1 + (-1) + 0| = 0, no near-win state
- Diagonal 2: |1 + (-1) + (-1)| = 1, no near-win state

From the near-win states, we can see that Player 1 (X) has near-win states in Column 1 and Column 3.

Based on the priority of moves, Player 1 (X) should play the move that marks the third cell in the near-win state:

Player 1 (X) should play in either Column 1 or Column 3. 

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is to play in Column 3, which means the coordinates for the next move are (3, 3).

The updated game state after Player 1's move is:

|  1  |  -1  |  1  |
|-----|------|-----|
|  0  |  -1  |  1  |
|  -1 |  1  |  1  |

```
  0  1  2
0 - - -
1 - X O
2 O X X

Using the game board representation matrix, we can calculate the sum for each row, column, and diagonal equation:

Rows:
```
- + O + X = 0
O + X + X = 1
O + X + X = 1
```

Columns:
```
O + X + X = 1
- + X + X = 0
O + O + X = -1
```

Diagonals:
```

```

Based on rule 5, let's check if there is a near-win state for either player.

Player 1 (X) - near-win states:

Rows:
```
| - + O + X | = 2 and one of -, O, X is 0  =>  | - + O + X | = 2 and - = 0
| O + X + X | = 2 and one of O, X, X is 0  =>  | O + X + X | = 2 and X = 0
```

Neither row has a near-win state for Player 1.

Columns:
```
| O + X + X | = 2 and one of O, X, X is 0  =>  | O + X + X | = 2 and X = 0
```

The second column has a near-win state for Player 1.

Diagonals:
```
| O + X + X | = 2 and one of O, X, X is 0  =>  | O + X + X | = 2 and X = 0
```

The first diagonal has a near-win state for Player 1.

Player 2 (O) - near-win states:

Rows:
```
| - + O + X | = 2 and one of -, O, X is 0  =>  | - + O + X | = 2 and - = 0
| O + X + X | = 2 and one of O, X, X is 0  =>  | O + X + X | = 2 and X = 0
```

Neither row has a near-win state for Player 2.

Columns:
```
| O + O + X | = 2 and one of O, O, X is 0  =>  | O + O + X | = 2 and X = 0
```

The third column has a near-win state for Player 2.

Diagonals:
```
| O + X + X | = 2 and one of O, X, X is 0  =>  | O + X + X | = 2 and X = 0
| - + X + O | = 2 and one of -, X, O is 0  =>  | - + X + O | = 2 and - = 0
```

Both diagonals have near-win states for Player 2.

Based on the priority of moves (rule 5), we prioritize making the winning move. If there is no winning move, we try to block the opponent's near-win move.

In this case, Player 1 (X) has a winning move in the second column (row 3). If Player 1 marks this cell, it will result in a win.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to mark cell (3, 2)."

```
  X |   | O  
 ---+---+---

Now, let's analyze the game board to determine the near-win states for each player:

- Player 1 (X):
  - Rows: None
  - Columns: None
  - Diagonals:
    - |X + O + X| = |1 + 0 + 1| = 2 and c_{1,1} = 0 (near-win state)

- Player 2 (O):
  - Rows: None
  - Columns: None
  - Diagonals: None

Since Player 1 has a near-win state in the diagonal from c_{1,1} to c_{3,3}, they should play in the empty cell of that diagonal to win the game. Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 would be (1, 1).

Note: If there are multiple near-win states for a player, they should choose the one that leads to a win in the fewest number of moves. However, in this case, there is only one near-win state for Player 1."

To determine the optimal next move, we need to evaluate the current state of the game and look for any winning or near-win conditions.

  -----------------
    X  |  O  |  O

    O  |  X  |

Now, let's identify the important terms in the summations for the rows, columns, and diagonals:

- Rows:
  - Row 1: 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0
  - Row 2: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
  - Row 3: (-1) + 1 + 0 = 0

  - Column 2: 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0
  - Column 3: (-1) + (-1) + 0 = -2

- Diagonals:
  - Diagonal from top left to bottom right: 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0
  - Diagonal from top right to bottom left: (-1) + (-1) + 0 = -2

We can observe that there are no winning conditions for either player at the moment. Now, let's check for any near-win conditions:

- Near-win states for Player 1:
  - None

- Near-win states for Player 2:
  - Row 2: |-1 + (-1) + 0| = 2 and c_{2,1} = 0. This is a near-win state.

Based on the priority of moves rule, if there is a near-win state for the opponent, we should block their win by playing our piece where they would play to achieve a win condition. In this case, if I as Player 1 block the near-win state, I need to play at position (2, 1).

Therefore, the optimal next move for me as Player 1 is to play at position (2, 1).

Based on the evaluation of the current game state, we can see that there is a near-win state in Row 2 and another near-win state in Column 2.

To play optimally, we should prioritize creating a win condition for ourselves if possible. If not, we should block our opponent's near-win state.

In this case, we have the opportunity to create a win condition in Row 2 or Column 2. If we mark the empty cell in either of these positions, we will win the game.

- Diagonals:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0
c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = -1

There are no winning conditions for either player at the moment.

Next, let's check if there are any near-win states for either player:

- Rows:
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = 0 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0
|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = 1 and one of c_{2,1}, c_{2,2}, c_{2,3} is 0
|c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = 1 and one of c_{3,1}, c_{3,2}, c_{3,3} is 0

- Columns:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = 1 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{2,1}, c_{3,1} is 0
|c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = 2 and one of c_{1,2}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,2} is 0
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = 0 and one of c_{1,3}, c_{2,3}, c_{3,3} is 0

- Diagonals:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = 0 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,3} is 0
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = 2 and one of c_{1,3}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,1} is 0

From the above analysis, we can see that Player 2 (O) has a near-win state in the second column. The sum of marks in the second column is 2, and one of the cells, c_{1,2}, is 0. Thus, Player 1 should block Player 2's win by placing their mark in the second column, in an empty cell. 

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is (1, 2).

Now let's evaluate the game board according to the rules provided. Starting with the winning conditions:

Rows:
- c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0 ✅ (not a winning row)
- c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1 ❌ (not a winning row)
- c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0 ✅ (not a winning row)

- c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0 ✅ (not a winning column)

Diagonals:
- c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 ❌ (not a winning diagonal)
- c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 ❌ (not a winning diagonal)

There are no winning conditions met at the moment.

Next, let's check the near-win states for each row, column, and diagonal:

Near-win states for rows:
- |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + (-1) + 1| = 2 ❌ (no near-win state for row 1)
- |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |1 + 1 + (-1)| = 1 ❌ (no near-win state for row 2)
- |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + (-1) + 0| = 0 ✅ (near-win state for row 3)

Near-win states for columns:
- |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 1 + 1| = 2 ❌ (no near-win state for column 1)
- |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |(-1) + 1 + (-1)| = 1 ❌ (no near-win state for column 2)
- |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + (-1) + 0| = 0 ✅ (near-win state for column 3)

Near-win states for diagonals:
- |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 ❌ (no near-win state for diagonal 1)
- |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2 ❌ (no near-win state for diagonal 2)

Based on the evaluation, there is a near-win state in column 3. Player 1 (X) can mark the third cell in that column to win the game. Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is (3, 3).

Please note that the game evaluation and optimal move may differ based on the actual game state and moves played. This is just an example based on the given sequence of moves."

- Rows:
    - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1 (not a winning condition)
    - c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1 (not a winning condition)

    - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1 (not a winning condition)

Since there is no near-win state for either player, we need to proceed based on the priority of moves.

As Player 1, we will check if there is any winning move available. Let's analyze each empty cell:

1. (1, 2):
   - If we mark this cell, the row sum for the first row will be 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (winning condition).
   - The diagonal sums will not be affected, and there are no near-win conditions created.
   - The column sum for the second column will also not be affected.
   - The column sum for the third column will be 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1 (not a winning condition).
   
2. (3, 3):
   - If we mark this cell, the sum for the second diagonal will be 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1 (not a winning condition).
   - The row sum for the third row will not be affected.
   - The column sums for the third column and the second column will also not be affected.
   - There are no near-win conditions created.
   
Based on the analysis, it is clear that marking cell (1, 2) will lead to a winning condition for Player 1. Therefore, the optimal next move is (1, 2).

c_{3,1} = -1, c_{3,2} = 1, c_{3,3} = 0

Now, let's check for any winning conditions:

- Rows:

c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -3

Based on the above evaluations, we do not currently have a winning condition.

Next, let's check for any near-win states for Player 1 (X):

- Rows:
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = |0| = 0
|c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |1 + (-1) + (-1)| = |1| = 1
|c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |-1 + 1 + 0| = |0| = 0

- Columns:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = |0| = 0
|c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |1 + (-1) + 1| = |1| = 1
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + (-1) + 0| = |-2| = 2

- Diagonals:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + (-1) + 0| = |0| = 0
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |(-1) + (-1) + (-1)| = |-3| = 3

It seems that there is a near-win state for Player 1 (X) in the diagonal represented by c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}, where the absolute value of the sum is 3.

Based on rule 5, since we have a near-win state, we should play the move that will mark the third empty cell in the near-win diagonal. In this case, the only empty cell in that diagonal is (3,1).

Therefore, the optimal move for Player 2 (O) is to play in cell (3,1).

Next game state after Player 2's move:

c_{1,1} = 0, c_{1,2} = 1, c_{1,3} = -1
c_{2,1} = 1, c_{2,2} = -1, c_{2,3} = -1
c_{3,1} = -1, c_{3,2} = 1, c_{3,3} = -1

Based on the evaluation, Player 2 has a near-win state in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal. Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 (X) is to block Player 2's potential win by marking the empty cell in that diagonal. Hence, the optimal move for Player 1 is (2, 2).

Now let's check if there are any winning or near-win conditions for either player:

Winning Conditions:
- No player has a winning condition yet.

Near-Win Conditions:
- Player 1 (X) has near-win conditions in:
  - Row 3: |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 and c_{3,1} = 0
  - Column 2: |1 + 1 + 1| = 3 and c_{1,2} = 0
  - Diagonal 2: |1 + 1 + 1| = 3 and c_{1,3} = 0

- Player 2 (O) has near-win conditions in:
  - Row 2: |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 and c_{2,1} = 0
  - Row 3: |0 + -1 + 1| = 2 and c_{3,2} = 0
  - Column 1: |0 + -1 + 0| = 1 and c_{2,1} = 0
  - Column 3: |1 + 1 + 1| = 3 and c_{3,2} = 0
  - Diagonal 1: |0 + -1 + 1| = 2 and c_{2,2} = 0
  - Diagonal 2: |0 + -1 + 0| = 1 and c_{2,3} = 0

Based on the priority of moves, we need to consider blocking the opponent's near-win conditions first before creating our own winning moves.

Player 2 (O) has the highest priority since they have a near-win condition in the diagonal 1. To block this, Player 1 needs to play their next move at position (2, 2):

Based on the current game board state, there is no winning move for either player. However, Player 1 (X) has a near-win state in column 2. Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 is to play in row 3, column 2, to complete the near-win and potentially win the game.

Here, X represents Player 1 (marks with 1), O represents Player 2 (marks with -1), and 0 represents an empty cell.

Next, let's check if there are any winning conditions for either player:

- Rows:
c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1 (not a winning condition)
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1 (not a winning condition)

c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0 (not a winning condition)

- Diagonals:

c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1 (not a winning condition)

Since there are no winning conditions yet, let's check for near-win states:

- Rows:
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + (-1) + 1| = |1| = 1 (not a near-win state)

|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = |2| = 2 (not a near-win state)
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 1 + (-1)| = |1| = 1 (not a near-win state)

Since there are no near-win states either, we need to consider the optimal move using the priority of moves.

Player 1 (X) plays next. Checking for winning moves, we can see that Player 1 has two X marks in the second row. The remaining empty cell in that row is (2, 1). Therefore, Player 1 should play their next move in cell (2, 1) to win the game.

- Rows:
1 + 2 + 0 = 3 (Player 1 wins!)

- Columns:

Next, let's check if there are any near-win states that we should prioritize.

Near-win states for Player 1:

- Diagonals:
  - Left Diagonal: |1 + 0 + 0| = 1, not a near-win condition
  - Right Diagonal: |(-1) + 0 + 1| = 0, not a near-win condition

There are two near-win conditions: one in the second row and another in the third row. 

To play optimally, we should try to block our opponent's near-win condition, if possible. In this case, our opponent has a near-win condition in the third row at position (3, 2). Therefore, the optimal move is to play at position (3, 2), marking it with our symbol 'X'.

Therefore, the optimal next move is (3, 2)."

Game State:
- Rows:
  - Row 1: X + O + X = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1 (No win condition)
  - Row 2: O + X + """" = (-1) + 1 + 0 = 0 (Near-win state for Player 1)

  - Diagonal 1: X + X + O = 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1 (No win condition)
  - Diagonal 2: O + X + O = (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1 (No win condition)

Based on the above evaluation, we can see that Player 1 (X) has a near-win state in Row 2 and Column 3. The next optimal move for Player 1 would be to play in the cell (2, 3) to create a winning condition in Column 3.

Therefore, the optimal next move is (2, 3)."

We can also represent the game board as a matrix:

Player 1 (X) has a winning condition in the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).

Since there is a winning move available for Player 1, the optimal next move would be to mark the empty cell in the main diagonal to win the game. The coordinates of the empty cell in the main diagonal are (3, 2).

Thus, the optimal next move is (3, 2)."

Next, let's calculate the sums for all rows, columns, and diagonals:

Row sums:
   - Row 1: c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
   - Row 2: c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = -1 + 1 + -1 = -1

Column sums:
   - Column 1: c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 0 + -1 + 0 = -1
   - Column 2: c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

   - Diagonal 2: c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1

Now, let's check if there is a near-win state for either player:

Near-win states for Player 1:
   - None

Near-win states for Player 2:
   - None

Based on the current game board and the absence of near-win states, neither player has a winning move. However, we can see that the third cell in the first row (1,3) is empty, creating a potential near-win state for Player 1.

Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 is to mark the third cell in the first row. The optimal next move for Player 1 is (1,3).

The updated game board after Player 1's move would be:

For Player 1 (X):

c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2 (no win)
c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 (no win)

- Diagonals:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 (no win)
c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 (no win)

For Player 2 (O):
- Rows:
c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2 (no win)
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (no win)
c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + 1 + 0 = 0 (no win)

c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + 1 + 0 = 0 (no win)

Based on the current state of the game, there are no winning moves or near-win states for either player.

To play optimally, we need to consider blocking the opponent's potential winning moves.

Since there are no immediate winning moves or near-win states, our priority is to block the opponent's winning move if there is one.

Next optimal move: (3, 3)"

2 | X | X | O |
  |___|___|___|
3 | O |   | X |

Now, let's analyze the game board and check for any near-win or winning states.

- Rows: 
  - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = -2
  - c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 1
  - c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = -1

- Columns:

  - c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 2
  - c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 0

- Diagonals: 
  - c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = -1
  - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = -1

From the above analysis, we can see that there are no near-win or winning states for Player 1 or Player 2.

Based on the priority of moves, since Player 1 doesn't have a winning move, we should check if Player 2 has a near-win state. 

Looking at the game board, we can see that Player 2 has a near-win state in the third column, where they have marked the (2, 3) and (3, 3) cells. By marking the (1, 3) cell, Player 2 would win the game.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 would be to block Player 2's win by marking the (1, 3) cell.

Now, let's check if there are any winning conditions for either player. We will evaluate all rows, columns, and diagonals:

- Rows:
   c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 => Not a winning condition
   c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1 => Not a winning condition
   c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0 => Not a winning condition

   c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 => Not a winning condition


Since there are no winning conditions for either player at the moment, let's check if there are any near-win conditions. 

- Rows:
   |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 2 => Near-win condition for X
   |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |(-1) + 1 + 1| = 1 => Not a near-win condition
   |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + (-1) + 1| = 2 => Near-win condition for O

- Columns:
   |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + (-1) + 0| = 1  => Not a near-win condition
   |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |1 + 1 + (-1)| = 1  => Not a near-win condition
   |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 1 + 1| = 1  => Not a near-win condition

- Diagonals:
   |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + 1| = 2 => Near-win condition for X
   |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 => Not a near-win condition

Based on the near-win conditions, it is player 1 (X)'s turn to play. Since there is a near-win condition for X in the first row and third diagonal, we should prioritize making a move that would complete either of these near-win conditions.

Therefore, the optimal next move for player 1 (X) is to place their mark in either cell (1, 3) or cell (2, 3).

Based on the current state, there are no winning conditions for either player. However, there is a near-win condition for Player 1 in Row 1 and a near-win condition for Player 2 in Column 3.

To play optimally, Player 1 should prioritize creating a win condition if possible. Since there are no winning moves available, Player 1 should block Player 2's near-win condition in Column 3 by playing at position (2, 3).

Based on the evaluation above, there are no winning conditions or near-win states for either player. Therefore, we need to prioritize creating a winning move by placing our mark.

It is currently Player 2's turn (O). By analyzing the game board, I suggest Player 2 to play at cell (2, 2) in order to block Player 1 from creating a winning condition:

    [O X O]
    [X O O]
    [X O X]

This move prevents Player 1 from winning with a diagonal of X marks from the top left to bottom right.

By observing the matrix, we can see that if player 1 marks the cell (2, 3), it would block the near-win state for player 2 in the second row. Therefore, the optimal next move for player 1 is (2, 3).

Here is the updated game board:

- Player 1 (X) near-win possibilities:
    - Rows: None

    - Diagonals: None

Based on the priority of moves, if it is your turn and there is a near-win state for you, play the move that will mark the third cell in the near-win. Since there is a near-win possibility for Player 1 in the diagonal, the optimal move for Player 1 is to mark the empty cell in the diagonal.

Therefore, the optimal move is (3, 3)."

Evaluation:
Based on the current game state, there are no near-win states for Player 1 or Player 2. Also, there is no winning move available for Player 1.

- Diagonals:
    - Diagonal 1: 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0. No near-win or winning condition.
    - Diagonal 2: 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0. No near-win or winning condition.

Based on the evaluation, there is a near-win condition for both Player 1 (Column 3) and Player 2 (Column 2). According to rule 5, we should prioritize our own near-win condition over blocking the opponent's. 

Therefore, the optimal move for Player 1 is to mark cell (3, 3) to complete the near-win in Column 3.

Based on the current state, there are no near-win states for either player.

Now, let's reason with the priority of moves:

As Player 1, if I have a winning move available, I should play it. However, there is no winning move for me at the moment.

As Player 2, if I have a winning move available, I should play it. However, there is no winning move for Player 2 as well.

Now, let's check if there are any near-win states for either player:

- In rows: The absolute value of the sum of each row's cells should be 2, and one of the cells should be empty.
  - Row 1: |1 + 0 + 0| = 1 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0. So, there is no near-win state in row 1.
  - Row 2: |-1 + 1 + (-1)| = 1 and one of c_{2,1}, c_{2,2}, c_{2,3} is 0. So, there is no near-win state in row 2.
  - Row 3: |1 + 0 + 1| = 2 and one of c_{3,1}, c_{3,2}, c_{3,3} is 0. So, there is a near-win state for Player 1 in row 3.

- In columns: The absolute value of the sum of each column's cells should be 2, and one of the cells should be empty.
  - Column 1: |1 + (-1) + 1| = 1 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{2,1}, c_{3,1} is 0. So, there is no near-win state in column 1.
  - Column 2: |0 + 1 + 0| = 1 and one of c_{1,2}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,2} is 0. So, there is no near-win state in column 2.
  - Column 3: |0 + (-1) + 1| = 0 and one of c_{1,3}, c_{2,3}, c_{3,3} is 0. So, there is no near-win state in column 3.

- In diagonals: The absolute value of the sum of the diagonal's cells should be 2, and one of the cells should be empty.
  - Diagonal 1 (top-left to bottom-right): |1 + 1 + 1| = 3, but none of the cells are empty. So, there is no near-win state in diagonal 1.
  - Diagonal 2 (top-right to bottom-left): |0 + 1 + 1| = 2, and one of c_{1,3}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,1} is 0. So, there is a near-win state for Player 1 in diagonal 2.

Based on the evaluation of near-win states, we can see that Player 1 (X) has a near-win state in the third row and diagonal 2.

According to the priority of moves (rule 5), Player 1 should play the move that marks the third cell in the near-win state. In this case, Player 1 should play in the third cell of the third row (i.e., position (3, 2)) to create a winning condition.

In the first row, the sum of the marks is -1 + 1 + 0 = 0, which is not equal to 2 or -2. Therefore, there is no near-win state in the first row.
In the second row, the sum of the marks is 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0, which is not equal to 2 or -2. Therefore, there is no near-win state in the second row.
In the third row, the sum of the marks is 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which is not equal to 2 or -2. Therefore, there is no near-win state in the third row.

- Columns:
In the first column, the sum of the marks is (-1) + 0 + 0 = -1, which is not equal to 2 or -2. Therefore, there is no near-win state in the first column.
In the second column, the sum of the marks is 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0, which is not equal to 2 or -2. Therefore, there is no near-win state in the second column.
In the third column, the sum of the marks is 0 + 1 + 1 = 2, which is equal to 2. Additionally, one of the cells in this column is empty (c_{3,3} = 0). Therefore, we have a near-win state for Player 1 in the third column.

- Diagonals:
In the main diagonal, the sum of the marks is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1, which is not equal to 2 or -2. Therefore, there is no near-win state in the main diagonal.
In the anti-diagonal, the sum of the marks is 0 + (-1) + 0 = -1, which is not equal to 2 or -2. Therefore, there is no near-win state in the anti-diagonal.

Since there is a near-win state for Player 1 in the third column, the optimal move for Player 1 is to mark the empty cell in the third column. Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is (3, 3).

There are no near-win states for Player 2 either.

Since there are no winning or near-win conditions for either player, we need to prioritize creating a winning condition for Player 1 or blocking a near-win condition for Player 2.

The optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to play at cell (1, 1) to create a winning condition in the first row:

From the above calculations, we can see that there are no immediate win states for either player. However, there is a near-win state for Player 2 (O) in the third column. The absolute sum of the third column is 0, and one of the cells is already marked by Player 2 (O).

1  O |   | X 
  ---+---+---
2  X | X | O 
  ---+---+---
3    | O | O 

```

To block Player 2's near-win condition in the third column, the optimal move for Player 1 (X) would be to mark cell (3, 3).

Player 2 (O) vs. Player 1 (X)

Therefore, the optimal next move is (3, 3)."

Now let's evaluate the game board based on the rules provided.

1. Winning conditions:

Rows:
```
0 + 0 + 0 = 0
1 + (-1) + 0 = 0
(-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1
```

Columns:
```
0 + 1 + (-1) = 0

0 + 0 + (-1) = -1
```

Diagonals:
```
0 + (-1) + (-1) = -2
0 + (-1) + 0 = -1
```

2. Near-Win states:

There are no near-win states for either player.

Based on the evaluation, there are no winning moves for Player 1 or near-win states for either player. 

Therefore, Player 1 should focus on blocking Player 2 from winning in the next move.

Next, we need to check the winning moves for Player 2:

Rows:
```
1 + (-1) + 0 = 0 (Potential near-win state for Player 2)
```

Columns:
```
1 + 0 + (-1) = 0 (Potential near-win state for Player 2)
```

Diagonals:
```
(-1) + (-1) + 0 = -2 (Potential near-win state for Player 2)
(-1) + 0 + 1 = 0 (Potential near-win state for Player 2)
```

From the above evaluation, we can see that the next move should be (1, 3) for Player 1 to block Player 2's near-win state in the first row.

Now let's evaluate the game state by applying the rules:

1. Winning conditions:
- Rows:
   - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0 (no win)

   - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 (no win)

2. Near-Win States:
- Rows:
   - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |-1 + 0 + 1| = 2 and c_{1,2} = 0 (near-win for Player 1)
   - |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |-1 + 0 + 1| = 2 and c_{2,2} = 0 (near-win for Player 1)
   - |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 0 + -1| = 2 and c_{3,2} = 0 (near-win for Player 1)
- Columns:
   - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |-1 + 1 + 1| = 1 (no near-win)

Based on the evaluation, there is a near-win state for Player 1 at cell (1, 2). Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to mark cell (1, 2) to secure a win.

```

Next, we need to evaluate the game board to identify any winning or near-win states.

Considering the winning conditions:

- Rows:
  - c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (Not a winning condition)
  - c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1 (Not a winning condition)
  - c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0 (Not a winning condition)

- Columns:
  - c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0 (Not a winning condition)
  - c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 (Not a winning condition)
  - c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1 (Not a winning condition)

- Diagonals:
  - c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 (Not a winning condition)
  - c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1 (Not a winning condition)

Currently, there are no winning conditions on the game board.

Now, let's check for near-win states:

- Rows:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 2 (Not a near-win state)
  - |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |-1 + 1 + 1| = 1 (Not a near-win state)
  - |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 0 + (-1)| = 2 (Not a near-win state)

- Columns:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + (-1) + 1| = 2 (Not a near-win state)
  - |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = 2 (Not a near-win state)
  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |-1 + 1 + (-1)| = 1 (Not a near-win state)

- Diagonals:
  - |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = 0 (Not a near-win state)
  - |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |-1 + 1 + 1| = 1 (Not a near-win state)

Since there are no near-win states for either player, we can proceed to check for the optimal move based on the priority of moves:

Priority of Moves:
1. Winning move - If there is a winning move, play it.
2. Block opponent's near-win state.

In the current state, there are no winning moves available for either player. However, Player 2 has a near-win state in the last column (Cell (1, 3)), and we need to block it.

Therefore, the optimal next move is to mark Cell (1, 3) with the symbol 'X'.

Updated game state:

[0, 1, 1]

By using the rules stated earlier, we can evaluate the win and near-win states.

Win State Check:

Rows:
- c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1

Diagonals:

- c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 0 + 1 + -1 = 0

There is no win state present, so we move on to check near-win states.

Near-Win State Check:

Rows:
- |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = | -1 + 0 + 0 | = 1 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0.
- |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = | 0 + 1 + 1 | = 2 and none of c_{2,1}, c_{2,2}, c_{2,3} is 0.

- |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = | 0 + 1 + -1 | = 0 and one of c_{1,3}, c_{2,2}, c_{3,1} is 0.

Based on the above evaluation, we can see that there is a near-win state for Player 2 (O) in the second column. In the second column, two cells have been marked by Player 2 (O), and the third cell is empty. Therefore, to block the potential win for Player 2 (O), the optimal move for Player 1 (X) is to choose (3, 2) as the next move.

1. Winning move: If there is a winning move available, play it.
2. Blocking move: If there is a near-win state for the opponent, block it.
3. Creating a near-win state: If no winning or blocking move is available, play a move that creates a near-win state for the player.

To determine the optimal next move, we need to analyze the game state and follow the rules provided.

1. Evaluate Winning Conditions:
There are no winning conditions for either player in the current state.

2. Evaluate Near-Win States:
- Rows:
   - Row 1: |X + O + X| = |1 + (-1) + 1| = 1 and c_{1,2} is 0 (near-win state)
   - Row 2: |O + O + X| = |(-1) + (-1) + 1| = 1 and c_{2,3} is 0 (near-win state)
   - Row 3: |O + X| = |(-1) + 1| = 0 (no near-win state)

- Columns:
   - Column 1: |X + O + O| = |1 + (-1) + (-1)| = 1 and c_{3,1} is 0 (near-win state)
   - Column 2: |O + O + X| = |(-1) + (-1) + 1| = 1 and c_{3,2} is 0 (near-win state)
   - Column 3: |X + X + X| = |1 + 1 + 1| = 3 (win state)

- Diagonals:
   - Main Diagonal: |X + O + O| = |1 + (-1) + (-1)| = 1 and c_{3,3} is 0 (near-win state)
   - Anti-Diagonal: |X + O + X| = |1 + (-1) + 1| = 1 and c_{3,1} is 0 (near-win state)

3. Priority of Moves:
Based on the near-win states, we can prioritize our moves as follows:
1. Play the winning move if available.
2. Block the opponent's near-win.
3. Create a near-win state for ourselves.

In the current state, we have both a winning move and a move to block the opponent's near-win. We should prioritize blocking the opponent's potential win.

Optimal Next Move: (3, 1)

Reasoning:
Playing at cell (3, 1) will block Player 2 from winning in the column and create a near-win state for Player 1 in the main diagonal.

Updated game state:
```
   1  2  3
1  X  O  X
2  O  O  X
3  X  X
```

Now it is Player 2's turn to play."

- Diagonals:

X + X + - = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 (No win)
X + X + X = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (Player 1 wins)

The diagonal `X + X + X = 3` indicates that Player 1 has won the game.

To determine the optimal next move, let's first represent the current game board:

     c_{1,1} | c_{1,2} | c_{1,3}
    ---------|---------|---------
     c_{2,1} | c_{2,2} | c_{2,3}
    ---------|---------|---------
     c_{3,1} | c_{3,2} | c_{3,3}

Based on the given sequence of moves, we can update the game board as follows:

     X |   | O
    ---|---|---
       | X | O
    ---|---|---
     O | X |

Now, let's evaluate the current game board for any win states or near-win states. 

1. Winning conditions:
- Rows:
   c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0 -> not a win
   c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0 -> not a win
   c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + 1 + 0 = 0 -> not a win
- Columns:
   c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0 -> not a win
   c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 -> not a win
   c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = (-1) + (-1) + 0 = -2 -> not a win
- Diagonals:
   c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 -> not a win
   c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = (-1) + 1 + 0 = 0 -> not a win

2. Near-win states:
- Rows:
   |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |1 + 0 + (-1)| = |0| = 0 -> not a near-win
   |c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3}| = |0 + 1 + (-1)| = |0| = 0 -> not a near-win
   |c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + 1 + 0| = |0| = 0 -> not a near-win
- Columns:
   |c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 0 + (-1)| = |0| = 0 -> not a near-win
   |c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = |1| = 1 -> near-win
   |c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3}| = |(-1) + (-1) + 0| = |(-2)| = 2 -> not a near-win
- Diagonals:
   |c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |1 + 1 + 0| = |2| = 2 -> not a near-win
   |c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |(-1) + 1 + 0| = |0| = 0 -> not a near-win

Based on the current game board evaluation, there is no winning move available. However, there is a near-win state in the second column.

To play optimally, we need to block the near-win state by marking the third cell in the second column. Therefore, the optimal move is to mark the cell (3, 2).

The updated game board after the optimal move:

     X |   | O

The game board representation can be shown as follows, where 'X' represents Player 1 and 'O' represents Player 2:

    O | O | X
    X | X | O
    O | X | 

Based on the given moves, we can calculate the sums for each row, column, and diagonal:

- Rows:
    Row 1: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
    Row 2: 1 + 1 + (-1) = 1
    Row 3: 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0

- Columns:
    Column 1: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
    Column 2: 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0
    Column 3: 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0

- Diagonals:
    Diagonal 1: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
    Diagonal 2: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

From the above calculations, we can observe that there are no near-win or win states for either Player 1 or Player 2. However, it's Player 1's turn to move.

According to the priority of moves (Rule 5), Player 1 should try to create a win as fast as possible. Based on the current game state, Player 1 can place their next move in either of the empty cells in Row 3 (Column 2 or Column 3) to create a win condition in that row.

Therefore, the optimal next move for Player 1 is to choose (3, 2) or (3, 3) to mark the empty cell in Row 3.

Final game board representation after Player 1's optimal move:

    O | O | X
    X | X | O
    O | X | X

Game Board:
[ 0  1  1 ]
[ 1  1 -1 ]
[-1  0  0 ]

Now, let's calculate the summations for all rows, columns, and diagonals:

Rows:
c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1
c_{3,1} + c_{3,2} + c_{3,3} = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1

Columns:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1} = 0 + 1 - 1 = 0
c_{1,2} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,2} = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
c_{1,3} + c_{2,3} + c_{3,3} = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0

Diagonals:
c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1

There are no winning conditions or near-win states for either player based on the current board status.

Now, let's consider the priority of moves. First, we check if it is our turn and we have a winning move available. If not, we need to check if our opponent has a near-win state.

In this case, it is our turn, and we don't have a winning move available. So, let's check if our opponent has a near-win state. 

Checking for near-win states:

Rows:
|c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = |0 + 1 + 1| = 2 (one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0)
Similar for the other rows.

Columns:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,1} + c_{3,1}| = |0 + 1 - 1| = 0
Similar for the other columns.

Diagonals:
|c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3}| = |0 + 1 + 0| = 1
|c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1}| = |1 + 1 - 1| = 1

Based on the above calculations, we can see that our opponent does not have a near-win state.

Since our opponent does not have a near-win state, we can play any empty cell. Let's choose the optimal move by selecting an empty cell that creates a potential near-win state for us in the next turn.

Optimal next move: (3, 3)

New game board after the optimal move:

[ 1  1 -1 ]

1. Game Board Representation:
   The game board can be represented as follows:
   
   ```
     1   2   3
   -------------
   1  X |   | O
   -------------
   2    | X | O
   -------------
   3  O | X |
   -------------
   ```
   
   Using the matrix notation, we have:
   ```
   c_{1,1} = 1, c_{1,2} = 0, c_{1,3} = -1,
   c_{2,1} = 0, c_{2,2} = 1, c_{2,3} = -1,
   c_{3,1} = -1, c_{3,2} = 1, c_{3,3} = 0
   ```

2. Winning conditions:
   - Rows:
     ```
     c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3} = 0
     c_{2,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{2,3} = 0

   - Diagonals:

     c_{1,1} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,3} = 0
     c_{1,3} + c_{2,2} + c_{3,1} = 0

3. Near-Win States:
   - Rows:
     ```
     |c_{1,1} + c_{1,2} + c_{1,3}| = 2 and one of c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, c_{1,3} is 0

     ```

4. Reasoning with the Priority of Moves:
   At the current state of the game, there are no near-win states for either player. We need to analyze the board to find the optimal move.

   From the current board, we can see that Player 1 (X) has created a near-win state in the first row, where two cells are marked by Player 1 and the third cell is empty. Player 1 can win the game by marking the empty cell in the first row. 

   The optimal move for Player 1 is to play in the first row and column 2:
   (1, 2)

By making this move, Player 1 will win the game:
```
   1   2   3
-------------
1  X | X | O
-------------
2    | X | O
-------------
3  O | X |
-------------
```
Congratulations Player 1 for the win!"
