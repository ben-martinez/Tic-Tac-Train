Question: With the following board what is the optimal move for the next player? The next player is 'O' [1,O,O,4,X,X,7,8,9]
Answer: 
It is O's turn. O has two in a row at 2, 3 and can place a third in a row at 1 so it is one move away from winning. X has two in a row at 6, 5 but cannot win before O can win. So the player should place it's third in a row to win. 
Therefore, the optimal move for 'O' is 1.

Question: With the following board what is the optimal move for the next player? The next player is 'O' [1,2,O,4,X,X,7,O,9]
Answer:
It is O's turn. O does not have two in a row. X has two in a row at 5, 6 and can place a third in a row at 4 so will win before O can win. So the player should place an O to block X's potential win. 
Therefore the optimal move for 'O' is 4. 

Question: With the following board what is the optimal move for the next player? The next player is 'O' [O,2,3,O,X,6,X,O,X]
Answer:
It is O's turn. O has two in a row at 1, 4 but it is blocked by X at 7. X has two in a row at 5, 7, and can place a third in a row at 3 so will win before O can win. So the player should place an O to block X's potential win. 
Therefore the optimal move for 'O' is 3. 

Question: With the following board what is the optimal move for the next player? The next player is 'O' [1,X,X,4,X,O,O,8,9]
Answer:
It is O's turn. O does not have two in a row. X has two in a row at 3, 5, but is blocked at 7. X has two in a row at 2, 3 and can place a third in a row at 1. X has two in a row at 2,5 and can place a third in a row at 8. X has two options for winning. Since O can only block one way, X will win before O can block both. So O will lose assuming X plays optimally, there is not an optimal play to win. The player should arbitrarily block one of the ways to block X's potential win. 
Therefore the optimal move for 'O' is 1 or 8. 

Question: With the following board what is the optimal move for the next player? The next player is 'O' [X,O,X,O,5,6,7,8,X]
Answer:
It is O's turn. O does not have two in a row. X does not have two in a row. There are only two potential rows that O could win if they remain without X. They are in 2,5,8 and 4,5,6. The overlap between these is 5. The player should place O at 5 because X cannot block both rows of winning in the following turn. 
Therefore the optimal move for 'O' is 5.
