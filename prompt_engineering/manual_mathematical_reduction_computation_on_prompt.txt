Let's play tic-tac-toe. We will use markers X and O, where X always goes first. The winning sequences are: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9], [1, 5, 9], [3, 5, 7]]. For each move, I want you to do 3 things: (1) Display the board graphically, (2) Generate and display distinct sorted combinations of a player's marker positions of length 2 and 3, and (3) Consider these combinations. If a 2-length combination is a subsequence of a winning sequence, you must make the winning move if it is your combination or block the winning move if it is the opposing player's combination. If a 3-length combination is a winning sequence, you must announce the win and the player who won. You should computationally do all these deductions. Do you understand?
