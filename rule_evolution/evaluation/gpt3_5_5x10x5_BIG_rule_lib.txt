Based on the provided information, here is an improved rule set for playing tic-tac-toe:\n\nRule 1 (Unchanged):\nIf there is a winning move available, take it.\n- A winning move is defined as a move that completes a line (row, column, or diagonal) of the player's symbol.\n\nRule 2 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has a winning move available, block it.\n- A winning move is defined as a move that completes a line (row, column, or diagonal) of the opponent's symbol.\n\nRule 3 (Unchanged):\nIf the player has two symbols in a line and the third space is empty, play in that space to create a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nRule 4 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has two symbols in a line and the third space is empty, block the opponent from creating a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nRule 5 (Unchanged):\nIf there are no potential winning moves for either player, play in the center square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nRule 6 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has played in the center square and there are no potential winning moves, play in a corner square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nRule 7 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has played in a corner square and there are no potential winning moves, play in the opposite corner if it is available.\n- Opposite corners are defined as pairs of diagonally opposing corners.\n\nRule 8 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has played in a corner square and there are no potential winning moves, play in a neighboring edge square if it is available.\n- Neighboring edge squares are defined as the adjacent squares to an edge.\n\nRule 9 (Improved):\nIf there are no potential winning moves and the opponent has played in a corner square, play in the adjacent corner square if it is available.\n- Adjacent corner squares are defined as the two corners adjacent to the corner square already occupied by the opponent.\n\nRule 10 (New):\nIf there are no potential winning moves and the player is the first to move, play in a random corner square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nThese rules aim to address the suboptimal moves identified in the provided game states, while still following the general principles of the original rule set. In particular, Rule 9 has been improved to prioritize playing in the adjacent corner square when the opponent has already occupied a corner square.
