Based on the provided information, here are the improved rules:\n\nRule 1 (Improved):\nAlways make your first move in a corner if you are the first player, unless the opponent holds a diagonal control with their two moves (opposite corners). In that case, prioritize the center or one of the sides. \n\nRule 2 (Unchanged):\nIf your opponent has taken the centre on their first move, place your marker in any corner. If not, take the center.\n\nRule 3 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has taken a corner and you are the second player, take the center. \n\nRule 4 (Improved):\nAlways block any immediate winning move from your opponent unless it gives them a fork on the following turn. In that situation, make a move that blocks an immediate win and also interrupts the fork.\n\nRule 5 (Unchanged):\nIf you have two in a row and can win, finish the line and win the game.\n\nRule 6 (Unchanged):\nIf you have two in a row and an option to make a fork (create two lines of two), choose to make a fork. This puts you in a position to win in two different ways.\n\nRule 7 (Improved):\nIf the opponent has two in a row, block their third move unless it results in them creating a fork. If blocking their third move would create their fork, then attack a point that would take away their fork.\n\nRule 8 (Unchanged):\nIn middle game, aim to create a fork where you threaten to win in two different lines on your next turn.\n\nRule 9 (Improved):\nIn the end game, fill in the empty spots starting from corners, then sides, and finally the center. However, prioritize moves that block a potential win by the opponent.\n\nRule 10 (Improved):\nOn a larger board, focus on controlling the center and blocking opponent's near-wins while attempting to create a line of your own markers. If the opponent has strong control over a particular line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal), consider reducing their control by interrupting their line.
