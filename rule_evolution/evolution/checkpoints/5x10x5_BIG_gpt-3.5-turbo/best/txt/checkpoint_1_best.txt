Evolution(library="Rule 1 (New):\nIf there is a winning move available, take it.\nIf there is a cell in any row, column, or diagonal that contains two of the same player's marks and one empty cell, taking that empty cell will result in a win for that player.

This should be the second priority move as it aims to prevent the opponent from winning.\n\nRule 3 (New):\nIf there are two of the same player's marks in a row, column, or diagonal and the third cell is empty, take it.\nIf there are two cells in any row, column, or diagonal that contain the same player's marks and one empty cell, taking that empty cell will create an opportunity for a winning move. This is the third priority move as it sets up potential wins.\n\nRule 4 (New):\nIf the center cell is empty, take it.\nTaking the center cell is a strategic move that provides more opportunities for winning and blocking the opponent. This is the fourth priority move as it offers a positional advantage.\n\nRule 5 (New):\nIf the opponent has marks in opposite corners, take a side cell.\nIf the opponent has marked two opposite corner cells, taking any side cell will decrease their chances of winning by blocking potential diagonal wins. This is the fifth priority move as it counters a specific opponent strategy.\n\nRule 6 (New):\nIf there is an empty corner cell, take it.\nTaking a corner cell provides strategic advantages such as potential winning moves and blocking the opponent. This is the sixth priority move as it offers a positional advantage.\n\nRule 7 (New):\nTake an edge cell if all previous rules do not apply.\nIf none of the previous rules can be applied, taking an edge cell is the last priority move. Edge cells still provide some strategic opportunities while being less critical compared to the other positions.\n\nThese additional rules aim to prioritize winning moves, blocking opponent's potential wins, and creating opportunities for wins.
