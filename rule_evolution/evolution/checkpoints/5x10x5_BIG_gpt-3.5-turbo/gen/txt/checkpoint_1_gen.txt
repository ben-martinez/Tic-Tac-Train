Evolution(library="Improved rule set:\n\nRule 1 (Unchanged):\nIf there is a winning move available, take it.\n- A winning move is defined as a move that completes a line (row, column, or diagonal) of the player's symbol.\n\nRule 2 (Improved):\nIf the opponent has a winning move available, block it.\n- A winning move is defined as a move that completes a line (row, column, or diagonal) of the opponent's symbol.\n\nRule 3 (Improved):\nIf there is a line that contains two of the player's symbols and an empty space, play in that space to create a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nRule 4 (Improved):\nIf the opponent has a line that contains two of their symbols and an empty space, block them from creating a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nRule 5 (New):\nIf there are no potential winning moves for either player, play in the center square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nRule 6 (Improved):\nIf the opponent played in the center square and there are no potential winning moves, play in a corner square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nRule 7 (Improved):\nIf the opponent played in a corner square and there are no potential winning moves, play in the opposite corner if it is available.\n- Opposite corners are defined as pairs of diagonally opposing corners.\n\nRule 8 (Improved):\nIf the opponent played in a corner square and there are no potential winning moves, play in a neighboring edge square if it is available.\n- Neighboring edge squares are defined as the adjacent squares to an edge.\n\nRule 9 (New):\nIf there are no potential winning moves and the player is the first to move, play in a random corner square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nRule 10 (New):\nIf there are no potential winning moves and the player is the second to move, play in the center square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nReasoning:\n- Rules 1 and 2 remain unchanged as they are the primary strategies for winning and blocking the opponent's winning moves.\n- Rules 3 and 4 remain unchanged but they need to be applied after Rules 1 and 2 to avoid suboptimal moves.\n- Rule 5 remains unchanged as it allows the player to occupy the center square, which is strategically advantageous.\n- Rule 6 is improved by specifying that it should only be applied when there are no potential winning moves.\n- Rule 7 is improved by specifying that it should only be applied when there are no potential winning moves.\n- Rule 8 is improved by specifying that it should only be applied when there are no potential winning moves.\n- Rule 9 is introduced to ensure that the player makes a random move in the corner square if there are no potential winning moves and they are the first to move. This adds variety to the game and avoids predictability.\n- Rule 10 is introduced to ensure that the player makes a move in the center square if there are no potential winning moves and they are the second to move. This avoids potential traps set up by the opponent.", eval_result_batch=EvalResultBatch(formatting_accuracy=0.5384615384615384, best_move_accuracy=0.21428571428571427, eval_results=[EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[1, 3, 7, 9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[7, 6, 5, 9, 1], gpt_move=2, best_moves=[3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.LOSING_START: 2>, game_sequence=[6, 9, 2, 1, 7, 8, 5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[3, 4]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[9, 5, 1, 3], gpt_move=2, best_moves=[7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[7, 9, 2], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.BEST_MOVE: 4>, game_sequence=[6, 4, 3, 2, 5, 9, 1], gpt_move=7, best_moves=[7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[7], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[5]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[1, 4, 5, 9, 2, 3], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.LOSING_START: 2>, game_sequence=[4, 2, 5, 9, 3, 1, 8], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[6, 7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[3, 9, 7, 5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[1]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[1, 5, 9], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[2, 4, 6, 8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.BEST_MOVE: 4>, game_sequence=[1, 2, 7, 4, 6, 9, 5], gpt_move=3, best_moves=[3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[8], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[2, 5, 7, 9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[3, 6, 2, 7, 5, 1], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[7, 2, 3, 5], gpt_move=6, best_moves=[8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[3, 9, 7, 5], gpt_move=6, best_moves=[1]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[3, 9, 4], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[1, 2, 8, 5, 3, 6, 7], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[4]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.BEST_MOVE: 4>, game_sequence=[3], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[5]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[8, 3, 7, 9, 5, 4], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[2]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.LOSING_START: 2>, game_sequence=[5, 6, 2, 7, 4, 3, 9], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[8, 1]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[3, 1, 7, 5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[2, 7, 9], gpt_move=2, best_moves=[1]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 7, 4], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[3], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[5]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[9, 3, 7, 2, 5], gpt_move=8, best_moves=[1]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.LOSING_START: 2>, game_sequence=[2, 4, 5, 7, 1], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[8, 9, 3, 6]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[8, 5, 6, 4], gpt_move=2, best_moves=[9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[6, 1, 7], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[9, 6, 4, 8, 5, 1, 7], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[3])]), formatting_score_cutoff=0.7)
