Evolution(library="Improvement to Rule 1 (Unchanged):\nIf there is a winning move available, take it.\n- A winning move is defined as a move that completes a line (row, column, or diagonal) of the player's symbol.\n\nImprovement to Rule 2 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has a winning move available, block it.\n- A winning move is defined as a move that completes a line (row, column, or diagonal) of the opponent's symbol.\n\nImprovement to Rule 3:\nIf there are two empty spaces in a row and the player's symbol is already present in one other space of that row, play in one of the empty spaces to create a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nImprovement to Rule 4:\nIf there are two empty spaces in a row and the opponent's symbol is already present in one other space of that row, block the opponent from creating a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nImprovement to Rule 5:\nIf there are two empty spaces in a column and the player's symbol is already present in one other space of that column, play in one of the empty spaces to create a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nImprovement to Rule 6:\nIf there are two empty spaces in a column and the opponent's symbol is already present in one other space of that column, block the opponent from creating a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nNew Rule 7:\nIf there is an empty space and the player's symbol is already present in two other spaces of a diagonal line, play in the empty space to create a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nNew Rule 8:\nIf there is an empty space and the opponent's symbol is already present in two other spaces of a diagonal line, block the opponent from creating a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nNew Rule 9:\nIf there are no potential winning moves for either player, play in the center square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nNew Rule 10:\nIf the opponent has played in the center square and there are no potential winning moves, play in a corner square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).", eval_result_batch=EvalResultBatch(formatting_accuracy=0.6896551724137931, best_move_accuracy=0.2,
