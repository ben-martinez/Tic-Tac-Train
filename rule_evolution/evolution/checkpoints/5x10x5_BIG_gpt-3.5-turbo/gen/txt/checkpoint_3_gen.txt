Evolution(library="Rule 1 (Unchanged):\nIf there is a winning move available, take it.\n- A winning move is defined as a move that completes a line (row, column, or diagonal) of the player's symbol.\n\nRule 2 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has a winning move available, block it.\n- A winning move is defined as a move that completes a line (row, column, or diagonal) of the opponent's symbol.\n\nRule 3 (Unchanged):\nIf the player has two symbols in a line and the third space is empty, play in that space to create a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nRule 4 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has two symbols in a line and the third space is empty, block the opponent from creating a potential winning move.\n- A potential winning move is defined as a move that, when paired with the existing symbols in a line, would complete the line.\n\nRule 5 (Unchanged):\nIf there are no potential winning moves for either player, play in the center square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nRule 6 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has played in the center square and there are no potential winning moves, play in a corner square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nRule 7 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has played in a corner square and there are no potential winning moves, play in the opposite corner if it is available.\n- Opposite corners are defined as pairs of diagonally opposing corners.\n\nRule 8 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has played in a corner square and there are no potential winning moves, play in a neighboring edge square if it is available.\n- Neighboring edge squares are defined as the adjacent squares to an edge.\n\nRule 9 (New):\nIf there are no potential winning moves and the player is the first to move, play in the center square of any edge if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nRule 10 (New):\nIf there are no potential winning moves and the player is the second to move, play in the center square if it is available.\n- Only applicable when the board has an odd size (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, etc.).\n\nExplanation:\n\nRule 9 ensures that if there are no potential winning moves and it is the player's first move, they strategically choose the center square of any edge. This creates more opportunities for the player to win in the future because it maximizes the number of lines that can be potentially completed.\n\nRule 10 remains the same as before, allowing the second player to play in the center square if it is available. This is still a good strategy as the center square is a position of influence and control, allowing the second player to block potential winning moves and create their own opportunities.\n\nThese improvements aim to address previously identified suboptimal moves and increase the overall performance of the rule set in making optimal moves.", eval_result_batch=EvalResultBatch(formatting_accuracy=0.6551724137931034, best_move_accuracy=0.21052631578947367, eval_results=[EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[5], gpt_move=8, best_moves=[1, 3, 7, 9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[5, 8, 9, 7], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[1]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[9, 3, 2, 8, 7, 5], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[1, 4, 6]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[3, 5, 7, 1], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[8, 2, 1], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[7, 9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[4, 6, 5, 2, 3, 7, 9], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[1]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.BEST_MOVE: 4>, game_sequence=[2], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[1, 3, 5, 8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[4, 1, 5, 3, 7, 8], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[6]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[1, 2, 9, 5], gpt_move=4, best_moves=[8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[1, 5, 9, 7], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[7, 5, 3], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[2, 4, 6, 8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[9, 8, 7, 6, 2, 5, 1], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[4]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[7], gpt_move=1, best_moves=[5]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[7, 9, 5, 3, 4, 8], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[1, 6]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[3, 5, 7, 8], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[2]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[9, 3, 1, 5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[3, 5, 7], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[2, 4, 6, 8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[6, 2, 1, 4, 7, 9, 5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[5], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[1, 3, 7, 9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[4, 7, 5, 9, 1, 2], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[6]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.LOSING_START: 2>, game_sequence=[5, 1, 2, 8, 7, 9, 6], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[3, 4]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[1, 5, 9, 3], gpt_move=2, best_moves=[7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[1, 2, 8], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[7, 9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[3, 6, 4, 1, 9, 8, 5], gpt_move=1, best_moves=[7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.BEST_MOVE: 4>, game_sequence=[3], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[5]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[6, 1, 5, 3, 8], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[2]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.BEST_MOVE: 4>, game_sequence=[3, 5, 7, 6], gpt_move=4, best_moves=[4]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[4, 5, 2, 6], gpt_move=7, best_moves=[1]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.BEST_MOVE: 4>, game_sequence=[3, 5, 7], gpt_move=2, best_moves=[2, 4, 6, 8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[5, 2, 8, 9, 1, 4, 3], gpt_move=6, best_moves=[7])]), formatting_score_cutoff=0.7)
