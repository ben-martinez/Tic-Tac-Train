Evolution(library='Here is the improved rule set:\n\nRule 1 (Unchanged):\nIf there is a winning move available, take it.\n\nRule 2 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has a winning move available, block it.\n\nRule 3 (Unchanged):\nIf no winning or blocking move is available, try to create a winning opportunity in the next move. Look for positions where two pieces are already in a row/column/diagonal and place the third to win.\n\nRule 4 (Unchanged):\nIf the center position is available, take it. The center position is important as it allows for more possible winning opportunities.\n\nRule 5 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has taken the center position, take a corner position. Corner positions allow for the creation of potential winning opportunities.\n\nRule 6 (Unchanged):\nIf none of the above conditions apply, take an edge position. Edge positions provide flexibility in creating winning opportunities and blocking the opponent.\n\nRule 7 (Unchanged):\nIf the board is completely empty, start in a corner position. This allows for maximum flexibility in creating winning opportunities.\n\nRule 8 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has placed two pieces in a row/column/diagonal and blocking is not possible, prioritize blocking the opponent from creating a winning opportunity.\n\nRule 9 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has only placed one piece on the board, prioritize taking a position that blocks them from creating a winning opportunity in future moves.\n\nRule 10 (Unchanged):\nIf none of the above conditions apply, prioritize taking a position that maximizes the number of near-wins for your pieces. Near-win positions are those where two of your pieces are already in a row/column/diagonal and placing the third piece would lead to a winning opportunity.\n\nRule 11 (Improved):\nIf the opponent has a near-win opportunity, prevent them from completing it by placing your piece in the winning position first.\n\nRule 12 (Improved):\nIf the opponent has taken two adjacent corners, take the center position. This prevents the opponent from creating two potential winning opportunities with their next move.\n\nRule 13 (Improved):\nIf the opponent has taken opposite corners, take any available corner position. This minimizes the opponent\'s potential winning opportunities and provides additional possibilities for your own winning opportunities.\n\nRule 14 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has placed two pieces in an "L" shape on one side of the board, prioritize taking a position that blocks them from completing the "L" shape. This reduces the opponent\'s winning opportunities and improves your own chances of winning.\n\nRule 15 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has placed two pieces that form a straight line on one side of the board, prioritize taking a position that blocks them from completing the straight line. This reduces the opponent\'s winning opportunities and improves your own chances of winning.\n\nRule 16 (New):\nIf there are multiple available winning moves, prioritize taking the move that allows for the creation of the most potential winning opportunities in future moves. This increases the chances of securing a win.\n\nRule 17 (New):\nIf the opponent has placed two pieces diagonally on one side of the board and blocking is not possible, prioritize taking a position that blocks them from completing the diagonal. This reduces the opponent\'s winning opportunities and improves your own chances of winning.\n\nRule 18 (New):\nIf the opponent has only placed one piece in a corner position, prioritize taking the center position. This blocks the opponent from creating a potential winning opportunity with their next move and allows for more winning possibilities for you.\n\nRule 19 (New):\nIf none of the above conditions apply, prioritize taking a position that minimizes the opponent\'s potential winning opportunities while maximizing your own.\n\nBy adding these new rules (Rule 16, Rule 17, Rule 18, and Rule 19), we can further enhance the rule set and minimize suboptimal moves based on the provided game examples.', eval_result_batch=EvalResultBatch(formatting_accuracy=0.4666666666666667, best_move_accuracy=0.14285714285714285, eval_results=[EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[8], gpt_move=8, best_moves=[2, 5, 7, 9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[9, 2, 5, 1, 7], gpt_move=7, best_moves=[3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[9, 6, 1, 5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[4]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[2, 8, 6, 5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[6, 7, 1], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[3, 4, 8, 2, 1, 9, 5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[8], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[2, 5, 7, 9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[5, 1, 7, 4], gpt_move=1, best_moves=[3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[4, 6, 5, 2, 9], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[1]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[7, 5, 3, 9], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[1]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[3, 5, 7], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[2, 4, 6, 8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[3, 8, 5, 1, 4, 6, 9], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.BEST_MOVE: 4>, game_sequence=[5], gpt_move=7, best_moves=[1, 3, 7, 9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[5, 1, 7, 4], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[8, 7, 1, 2, 3, 5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[9, 4, 6]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[7, 5, 3, 9], gpt_move=2, best_moves=[1]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[2, 8, 7], gpt_move=6, best_moves=[1, 3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[5, 3, 7, 4, 6, 8, 1], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.BEST_MOVE: 4>, game_sequence=[4], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[1, 5, 6, 7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[1, 8, 5, 7, 3], gpt_move=4, best_moves=[9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[3, 5, 7, 4], gpt_move=7, best_moves=[6]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[1, 3, 9, 5], gpt_move=1, best_moves=[7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[1, 4, 6], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[3, 9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[1, 9, 7, 2, 8, 4, 5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[3]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[5], gpt_move=5, best_moves=[1, 3, 7, 9]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[2, 7, 5, 9, 4], gpt_move=3, best_moves=[8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[1, 5, 9, 6], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[4]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.MOVE_NOT_FOUND: 1>, game_sequence=[4, 2, 8, 5], gpt_move=None, best_moves=[7]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[7, 5, 3], gpt_move=3, best_moves=[2, 4, 6, 8]), EvalResult(type=<EvalResultType.SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE: 3>, game_sequence=[2, 1, 5, 6, 9, 8, 3], gpt_move=4, best_moves=[7])]), formatting_score_cutoff=0.7)
