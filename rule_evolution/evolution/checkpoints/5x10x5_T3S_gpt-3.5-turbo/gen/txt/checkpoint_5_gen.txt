Evolution(library="Rule 1 (Unchanged):\nIf there is a move that would immediately guarantee a win for the current player, take it.\n\nRule 2 (Unchanged):\nIf there is a move that would immediately guarantee a win for the opponent, block it.\n\nRule 3 (Improved):\nIf there are two empty cells in any row, column, or diagonal and exactly one of them is occupied by the current player, place a mark on the empty cell to create an opportunity for a winning move.\n\nRule 4 (Improved):\nIf there are two empty cells in any row, column, or diagonal and exactly one of them is occupied by the opponent, place a mark on the empty cell to prevent the opponent from making a winning move.\n\nRule 5 (Unchanged):\nIf there are no winning moves for the current player, no moves to block the opponent, and the center cell is available, take it.\n\nRule 6 (Unchanged):\nIf the center cell is occupied by the opponent and there are no winning moves, moves to block, or opportunities to create a winning move, choose a corner cell to create more opportunities for winning moves.\n\nRule 7 (Unchanged):\nIf the center cell is occupied by the current player and there are no winning moves, moves to block, or opportunities to create a winning move, choose an empty corner cell.\n\nRule 8 (Unchanged):\nIf the corner cells are occupied by the opponent and there are no winning moves, moves to block, or opportunities to create a winning move, choose a side cell.\n\nRule 9 (Unchanged):\nIf the side cells are occupied by the opponent and there are no winning moves, moves to block, or opportunities to create a winning move, choose a side cell adjacent to the opponent's marks.\n\nRule 10 (Improved):\nIf none of the above conditions are met, place the mark in a cell that is closest to an empty cell that is diagonally adjacent to a corner cell, while also minimizing the opponent's potential winning moves in the next turn.", eval_result_batch=EvalResultBatch(formatting_accuracy=0.8275862068965517,
