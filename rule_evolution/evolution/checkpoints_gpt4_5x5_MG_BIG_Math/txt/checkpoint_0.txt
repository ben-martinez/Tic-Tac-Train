Evolution(library='Without specific examples of when the previous rule set resulted in suboptimal moves, it\'s difficult to improve the rules. However, here\'s an attempt to increase the robustness of the rule set by factoring in more game possibilities and strategies.\n\n1. Game Board Representation (Unchanged) \n\n2. Player Moves (Unchanged) \n\n3. Winning Conditions (Unchanged)\n\n4. Near-Win States (Unchanged)\n\n5. Priority of Moves (Improved)\nWhile the original rule 5 was not incorrect, it might lead to suboptimal play. Therefore, we can replace it with a more specific sequence of priorities:\n\n- If there\'s a move that will make you win, take it.\n- If there\'s a move that will make the opponent win on their next turn, block it.\n- If there\'s a move that will make a two-in-a-row that the opponent cannot block on their next turn, take it.\n- If there is a possibility to create a fork (a situation where you can create two threats to win on your next turn), take it.\n- If there\'s a move that will block an opponent\'s fork, take it.\n- If the center square is free, take it.\n- If there\'s an opportunity to make a corner, take it.\n- Take an open square on a side (edge).\n\n6. Fork Scenarios (New)\nA situation where you can win in two ways is called a "fork." \n\n- c_{i,j} where two cells c_{p,q} and c_{r,s} exist such that c_{i,j} + c_{p,q} = 2 and c_{i,j} + c_{r,s} = 2.\n\n7. Blocking opponent\'s Forks (New)\nIf the opponent can create a fork, block it.\n\n8. Centre Square (New)\nThe center square is the most advantageous position in the tic-tac-toe, therefore if it\'s free, take it.\n\n9. Corners (New)\nCorners are the second most advantageous positions. \n\n10. Sides (New)\nLastly, edges or sides are less advantageous than middle and corners. So these should be the last priority. \n\nNote: When board is larger than 3x3, these rules may still not provide optimal play. Tic-tac-toe becomes much more complex in larger dimensions, and optimal play is more likely to involve a \'minimax\' algorithm, which cannot be encapsulated in a simple rule set.', formatting_accuracy=0.8888888888888888, best_move_accuracy=0.6875, failed_sequences=[([3, 9], [1, 2, 7]), ([2, 8, 9], [1, 3]), ([5, 7, 8], [2]), ([4, 5, 9], [1, 2, 7, 8]), ([1, 7], [2, 3, 9])])

Evolution(library="Without specifying the examples where the previous rule set resulted in a sub-optimal move, I cannot provide accurate improvements. However, I can suggest a revised rule set with common tic-tac-toe strategies that can strengthen the earlier rule set, taking into account a generalized board of size n x n.\n\nRule 1 (Unchanged):\nThe representation of the game board remains the same.\n\nRule 2 (Unchanged):\nPlayer moves are to be executed in the same manner.\n\nRule 3 (Improved):\nTo generalize for larger board dimensions, a player wins when they have n of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal where n is the dimension of the board, i.e., if the sum across a row/column/diagonal evaluates to +/- n.\n\nRule 4 (Improved):\nA near-win state is when a player has n-1 marks in a line and the remaining cell(s) are empty. This can be calculated by checking if the absolute sum across the row/column/diagonal equals n-1 and at least one of the cells is equal to 0.\n\nRule 5 (New):\nIf it is possible to create multiple near-win states, opt for this move.

Evolution(library='"Example 1: If there are two near-win states for the opponent and only one available move for you to block one of them, you will lose in the next turn. \n\nExample 2: If the opponent\'s next move will create multiple near-win states (fork), the previous rules does not account for this situation, so you might miss the opportunity to prevent it. \n\nExample 3: If no one has a winning or a near-winning condition, the current rule set does not provide a direction to play the piece, allowing for suboptimal positioning that may lead to future lost opportunities.\n\nTaking these examples into consideration, the new rule set is as follows:\n"\n"Rule 1 (Unchanged): Game Board Representation\nThe board size can be generalized to an n x n grid. In this case, c_{i, j} will represent the cell in the i-th row and j-th column, with the same representation for empty cell (0), Player 1 (1), and Player 2 (-1).

This can be done by checking whether:\nThe opponent\'s next move will create at least two rows, columns or diagonals such that |Σ(c_{i, j}, i, j in defined by the row/column/diagonal)| = n-1\n\nRule 6 (New): Saving Move\nIn situations where blocking a single near-win state won\'t prevent the opponent from winning in their next move, as they have more than one near-win states, look for a move that may create a winning condition in the next turn, forcing your opponent to reply instead of playing the winning move. \n\nRule 7 (New): Opening Moves\nIn case of a tie, meaning no one can potentially win in the next move, prioritize playing in the center of the board if it is empty (c_(n/2 + 1, n/2 + 1) = 0 for odd n; any of the four central cells for even n). If the center of the board is already occupied, the player may choose any corner cell.\n\nRule 8 (New): Game Progression\nA mid-game state occurs when there is at least one mark on the board and no player can win in their next move. In this case prioritize creating a near-win state if possible. \n\nRule 9 (Improved): Priority of Moves\nPrioritize moves based on the following order:\n- Winning moves\n- Blocking the opponent\'s winning moves\n- Saving moves (create a winning condition in the next turn when the opponent is in a near-win state)\n- Blocking high threat moves of the opponent\n- Moves that create a near-win \n- Opening moves\n- Any move\n\nRule 10 (New): Final Moves\nIn the end-game state, when there are no cells left for a beneficial strategy, choose a random empty cell."', formatting_accuracy=0.9444444444444444, best_move_accuracy=0.4117647058823529, failed_sequences=[([2, 4, 5, 9], [8]), ([3, 9], [1, 2, 7]), ([1, 3, 5, 8], [9]), ([5, 7, 8], [2]), ([3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]), ([1, 2, 6, 7], [5, 9]), ([2, 8, 9], [1, 3]), ([3, 5, 9], [6]), ([5, 7, 8], [2]), ([1, 3, 5, 8], [9])])

Evolution(library='The previous rule set is generally solid but it lacks rules that prioritize the center and corners. These spots are critical to winning tic-tac-toe in most cases, so we need to add rules that emphasize their importance. Additionally, the rule set does not work on larger boards as is. It also counts defensive and offensive "near-win" states the same, but it is more urgent to block an opponent\'s near-win than to create own near-win. Lastly, it does not take into account the fork tactic, which is an advanced strategy where a player creates two threats at once, forcing their opponent to block one while allowing the other. \n\nHere are the improved rules given these criteria:\n\nRule 1 (Improved):\nThe board has dimensions n x n where n can be any positive integer, accommodating a larger than 3x3 grid. c_{i, j} represents the cell in the i-th row and j-th column. Each cell can have states: \n- 0 for an empty cell, \n- 1 for a cell marked by Player 1 (X),\n- -1 for a cell marked by Player 2 (O)\n\nRule 2 (Improved):  \nA player may choose any cell c_{i, j} where c_{i, j} = 0. Move is invalid otherwise.\n\nRule 3 (Unchanged) \n\nRule 4 (Improved): \nA near-win state is when a player has p marks in a line and the remaining cells are empty, where p is either n-1, n-2 etc., depending on the size of the board. If player has n-1 cells marked, it\'s critical (urgent).\n\nRule 5 (Improved):\nBoth offensive and defensive near-wins (own and opponent’s) are checked each round, but greater weightage is given to blocking opponent\'s critical near-win situation over extending own near-win. \n\nRule 6 (New):\nThe center cell, if empty, should be marked as a priority because it\'s part of the most potential wins.\n\nRule 7 (New):\nIf the center is taken, occupy the corner cells, c_{1,1}, c_{1,n}, c_{n,1}, c_{n,n} in the order. \n\nRule 8 (New):\nIf center and corners are taken, occupy the side cells, the rest of the board. \n\nRule 9 (New):\nIf a fork opportunity (creating two near-wins with one move) presents itself, prioritize it over Rules 6-8. \n\nRule 10 (New):\nIf the opponent can create a fork next turn, block it.
