Evolution(library='While the current rule set describes an optimal strategy for a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board, it might not perform as well on larger boards. Also, it lacks thoroughness in considering all applicable game states. Looking at the presented suboptimal moves and game states, the following modified ruleset is proposed:\n\n1. Game Board Representation (Unchanged)\nKeep the coordinate system intact. The board state would be represented by the matrix of dimensions n√ón where each cell would be represented by c_{i,j}. \n\n2. Player Moves (Unchanged)\nPlayers choose their move by picking an unoccupied cell c_{i,j}.\n\n3. Winning Conditions (Unchanged)\nA player wins when they occupy an entire row, column or diagonal exclusively.\n\n4. Near-Win States (Improved)\nWe previously only checked for states where a move would result in a win. Now, use a rule to check for states where blocking an action by the opponent would prevent them from getting a near-win state in their next turn. \n\n5. Priority of Moves (Improved)\nDetermine the move priority based on the state of the board. \n\n- If there\'s a move that will make you win, take it.\n- If there\'s a move that will make the opponent win on their next turn, block it.\n- If there\'s a move that creates a fork, take it.\n- If there\'s a move that will block an opponent\'s fork, take it.\n- If the center square is free, take it.\n- If there\'s an opportunity to make a corner, take it.\n- Take an open square on a side (edge).\n\n6. Fork Scenarios (Unchanged)\nMaintain the definition of a "fork". \n\n7. Blocking opponent\'s Forks (Unchanged)\nBlock potential "forks" of the opponent.\n\n8. Centre Square (Unchanged)\nTake the centre square, if available. \n\n9. Corners (Improved)\nIn a larger board, corners may vary in utility. Still, they generally have less exposure, so it is beneficial for a player to try to occupy them rather than an edge. Thus, the revised rule would state "if there\'s an opportunity to take the corners or an adjacent square to the saved corners, take it."\n\n10. Sides (Improved)\nLastly, if no other better move is found, the player should take an edge square. The added provision in this rule is that the edge square should maintain the maximum possible distance from opponent\'s occupied squares to limit their chances of creating a fork. "Take an open square on a side (edge) maintaining maximum possible distance from opponent\'s occupied squares." \n\nNote: Optimality of these rules still cannot be guaranteed in all situations with larger than 3x3 board sizes, as minimax algorithms that consider all possibilities for sub-tree of upcoming moves is a more reliable method to find optimal moves.', formatting_accuracy=0.8333333333333334, best_move_accuracy=0.7333333333333333, failed_sequences=[([5, 7, 9], [1]), ([2, 6, 9], [5]), ([1, 5, 9], [2, 4, 6, 8]), ([2, 3, 5, 8, 9], [1])])
