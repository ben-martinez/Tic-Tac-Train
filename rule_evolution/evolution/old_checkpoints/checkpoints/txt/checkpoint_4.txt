If there are no other available strategies and no corners are available, then pick a side: (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), or (2,3).\n\nThis updated rule set aims to ensure that even in complex game states where the player is cornered, and the opponent is at the center, the player can make a move minimizing the opponent's chances of winning. Moreover, this rule set prioritizes preventing opponents from forming forks over forming two in a line, thus minimizing the chances for the opponent to win in the next two moves. Future optimizations may involve the further refinement of these rules.", formatting_accuracy=0.9, best_move_accuracy=0.6666666666666666, failed_sequences=[([3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]), ([3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]), ([3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8])])

Evolution(library="Given the previous feedback, here's the revised rule set:\n\nRule 1: (Unchanged)\nStart in the center. If the board is empty, the first move should be (2,2).\n\nRule 2: (Unchanged)\nCreate a fork whenever possible. If there are two non-overlapping choices of a cell that completes two lines of two markers, choose one. \n\nRule 3: (Unchanged)\nBlock an opponent's fork. If the opponent has two possible ways to win in its next turn, play the required block.\n\nRule 4: (Unchanged)\nTake the winning move. If a move at (i,j) completes a line of three of your markers, make that move.\n\nRule 5: (Unchanged)\nBlock an opponent's winning move. If the opponent has a potential winning move at (x,y), block it by placing your marker at (x,y).\n\nRule 6: (Modified/Improved)\nIf there's a cell (i,j) such that placing your marker there results in a line of two of your markers without giving the opponent a winning move, go for it. This ensures avoiding gifting the opponent a win with your move.\n\nRule 7: (Unchanged)\nWhen the opponent is in the center and you are in the corner, playing in a non-corner and non-center cell adjacent to your corner is optimal. \n\nRule 8: (Unchanged)\nPlay in the cells adjacent to the corner. If the opponent has a marker in any corner, and the cells (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), or (2,3) are available, then these moves are also optimal.\n\nRule 9: (Improved)\nIn the absence of the above conditions, play in the corner provided it doesn't allow opponent's win in the next move. \n\nRule 10: (Improved)\nIn the absence of the above conditions, play on the side-cell if doing so doesn't concede a win in the opponent's next move.\n\nComments:\nThe previous rules did not take into account the fact that the moves should be such that they do not provide a winning opportunity to the opponent in the next move. The revised rules cater to this aspect and thus lead to a more optimal gameplay by avoiding losing situations.", formatting_accuracy=0.7, best_move_accuracy=0.7142857142857143, failed_sequences=[([3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]), ([3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8])])
