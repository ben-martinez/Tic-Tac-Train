However, the optimal move for X in this case would be to take the top right corner, leading to a win.\n\nTo improve the rule set, we need to incorporate rules that consider all important states of the game and aim to make the most optimal moves. We should create rules that don\'t require running an algorithm and formalize them using mathematical notation. Additionally, these rules should work even if the tic-tac-toe board is larger than a 3x3 board.', formatting_accuracy=0.8888888888888888, best_move_accuracy=0.125, failed_sequences=[([5], [1, 3, 7, 9]), ([5, 9, 3, 6], [7]), ([7, 3, 6, 4, 1, 5], [8, 9, 2]), ([3, 5, 7, 9], [1]), ([6, 4, 1], [3, 9]), ([4, 6, 9, 1, 3, 8, 5], [7]), ([8], [2, 5, 7, 9]), ([5, 3, 8, 1, 4], [2]), ([1, 5, 9, 4], [6]), ([7, 1, 3, 5], [9]), ([7, 5, 3, 6], [4]), ([4, 8, 2, 5], [1]), ([4, 6, 3], [1, 7]), ([2, 8, 7, 4, 5, 3, 1], [9])])
