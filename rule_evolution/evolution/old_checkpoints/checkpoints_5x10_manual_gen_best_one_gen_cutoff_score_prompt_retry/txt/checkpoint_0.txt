It reduces the opponent's possibilities for creating a winning row/column/diagonal.\n\nRule 7 (New):\nIf the opponent has taken an edge space and there is a corner space available, take it. It increases your chances of creating a winning row/column/diagonal while limiting the opponent's options.\n\nRule 8 (New):\nIf there are no winning moves or blocking moves available, take an available corner space.

Evolution(library="Rule 1 (New): \nIf there is a winning move available for the current player, take it.\nExplanation: The primary objective in tic-tac-toe is to win the game. If there is a move that leads to an immediate victory, it should always be taken. This rule ensures that the current player does not miss an opportunity to win.\n\nRule 2 (New):\nIf the opponent has a winning move available, block it.\nExplanation: To prevent the opponent from winning, it is important to block any winning moves they have. This rule ensures that the current player prioritizes blocking the opponent's potential wins over other moves.\n\nRule 3 (New):\nIf there are two squares with your marks in a row, column, or diagonal, and the third square is empty, take it.\nExplanation: When a player has two marks in a row, column, or diagonal, they are one move away from winning the game. By taking the empty square, the current player sets up a winning position in the next turn.\n\nRule 4 (New):\nIf there are two squares with the opponent's marks in a row, column, or diagonal, and the third square is empty, block it.\nExplanation: Similar to Rule 3, this rule focuses on preventing the opponent from winning.

Corner cells also offer strategic positions for potential wins.\n\nRule 5 (New):\nIf the center and corner cells are occupied, place your symbol in an edge cell. These cells have limited strategic potential, but still provide opportunities for future wins.\n\nRule 6 (New):\nIf there are no optimal moves available based on the above rules, choose any remaining empty cell.
