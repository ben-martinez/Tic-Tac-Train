This helps to reduce the chances of the opponent creating a winning row/column/diagonal.\n\nRule 7: It has been improved to prioritize taking a corner space if the opponent has taken an edge space. This increases the chances of creating a winning row/column/diagonal while limiting the opponent's options.\n\nRule 8: It has been improved to prioritize taking an available corner space when there are no winning moves or blocking moves available. Corner spaces provide more opportunities for creating winning rows/columns/diagonals compared to edge spaces.\n\nRule 9: It has been improved to prioritize taking an available edge space only when there are no winning moves, blocking moves, or corner spaces available. Edge spaces can still contribute to creating winning rows/columns/diagonals, but they are less advantageous than corners.\n\nThese improvements aim to address the suboptimal moves observed in the provided examples and ensure that the rule set generates more optimal moves in a variety of game states.", formatting_accuracy=0.8235294117647058, best_move_accuracy=0.42857142857142855, failed_sequences=[([5], [1, 3, 7, 9]), ([2, 5, 4, 6], [1]), ([4, 3, 5, 9, 2], [6]), ([3, 5, 7, 6], [4]), ([1, 5, 9, 7], [3]), ([7, 5, 3], [2, 4, 6, 8]), ([9, 3, 8, 1, 5, 6], [2, 7]), ([8, 5, 4, 2], [7])])
