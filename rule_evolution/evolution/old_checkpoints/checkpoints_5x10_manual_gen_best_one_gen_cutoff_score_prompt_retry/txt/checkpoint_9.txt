This move prevents the opponent from forming winning rows or columns in the next move.\n\nRule 13 (New):\nIf the opponent has a row or column with one mark and the other two cells in that row or column are empty, avoid making a move that allows the opponent to complete the row or column. Instead, place your mark in a row or column with fewer empty cells.\n\nRule 14 (New):\nIf the opponent has placed two marks in different diagonals and the remaining cell in both diagonals is empty, prioritize taking the remaining cell. This move prevents the opponent from forming a winning diagonal in the next move.\n\nRule 15 (Improved):\nIf the opponent has placed two marks with a distance of one cell in a diagonal and the remaining diagonal cells are empty, prioritize taking the remaining cell. This move prevents the opponent from forming a winning diagonal in the next move.\n\nRule 16 (Improved):\nIf the opponent has placed two marks in different diagonals with a distance of one cell and the remaining cells in both diagonals are empty, prioritize taking the remaining cells. This move prevents the opponent from forming a winning diagonal in the next move.\n\nRule 17 (New):\nIf the opponent has a near-win position (two marks in a row/column/diagonal with an empty cell that would complete the win), prioritize blocking their win by taking the empty cell.\n\nRule 18 (Improved):\nIf the opponent has three marks forming a possible winning row/column/diagonal, prioritize taking an empty cell that prevents the opponent from completing the win.\n\nRule 19 (Improved):\nIf the opponent has two marks forming a possible winning row/column/diagonal with a distance of one cell, prioritize taking the empty cell that prevents the opponent from completing the win.\n\nRule 20 (New):\nIf the opponent has placed two marks that would result in a fork (the opponent can create two possible winning positions in the next move), prioritize blocking the fork by taking one of the necessary cells.\n\nRule 21 (New):\nIf the opponent has placed one mark and there is an empty corner space available that is part of a row/column/diagonal with your own mark, take the available corner space. This move prevents the opponent from easily blocking your potential win by occupying the corner space.\n\nNote: The numbering of the rules has been adjusted to include the new rules.", formatting_accuracy=0.7058823529411765, best_move_accuracy=0.3333333333333333, failed_sequences=[([7, 4, 5, 1], [3]), ([9, 6, 1, 5], [4]), ([1, 7, 9, 5], [3]), ([7, 9, 3, 5], [1]), ([1, 5, 9], [2, 4, 6, 8]), ([6, 9, 7, 2, 1, 4, 5], [3]), ([8, 1, 6, 7, 5], [4]), ([8, 9, 5, 4, 1, 2, 7], [3])])

Evolution(library="The improved rule set with the new improvements based on the provided examples is as follows:\n\nRule 1 (Unchanged):\nIf there is a winning move available, take it.\n\nRule 2 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has two in a row and completing that row would result in a win for them, block their winning move.\n\nRule 3 (Unchanged):\nIf there are two of your own marks in a row, complete the row for a win.\n\nRule 4 (Unchanged):\nIf there are two opponent marks in a row with an empty space, block the opponent from winning by filling that space.\n\nRule 5 (Unchanged):\nIf the center space is available, take it. It provides more opportunities for winning.\n\nRule 6 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has taken a corner space and there is another corner space available, take it. It reduces the opponent's possibilities for creating a winning row/column/diagonal.\n\nRule 7 (Unchanged):\nIf the opponent has taken an edge space and there is a corner space available, take it. It increases your chances of creating a winning row/column/diagonal while limiting the opponent's options.\n\nRule 8 (Improved):\nIf there are no winning moves or blocking moves available, take the opposite corner space if it is available. This increases the chances of creating a winning row/column/diagonal while preventing the opponent from achieving the same.\n\nRule 9 (Improved):\nIf there are no winning moves, blocking moves, or corner spaces available, take an available edge space. Edge spaces can still contribute to creating winning rows/columns/diagonals, but they are less advantageous than corners.\n\nExplanation:\nBased on the provided examples, we can see that the previous rule set made suboptimal moves in certain game states. To address these suboptimal moves, the following improvements have been made:\n\nRule 8: It has been improved to prioritize taking the opposite corner space if available when there are no winning moves or blocking moves available. By taking the opposite corner, it not only increases the chances of creating a winning row/column/diagonal, but it also prevents the opponent from achieving the same.\n\nRule 9: It has been improved to prioritize taking an available edge space only when there are no winning moves, blocking moves, corner spaces, or opposite corner spaces available. Edge spaces are less advantageous than corners, but they can still contribute to creating winning rows/columns/diagonals.\n\nThese improvements aim to ensure that the rule set generates more optimal moves in a variety of game states while considering all important states of the game.", formatting_accuracy=0.8823529411764706, best_move_accuracy=0.3333333333333333, failed_sequences=[([5, 1, 8, 3, 4], [2]), ([2, 6, 4, 5], [1]), ([9, 3, 4], [1]), ([3, 2, 7, 5], [8]), ([3, 5, 7, 9], [1]), ([8, 3, 1], [9]), ([2], [1, 3, 5, 8]), ([8, 3, 7, 4, 5, 1], [9, 2]), ([1, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6], [9]), ([7, 4, 1, 8, 5, 3, 2], [9])])
