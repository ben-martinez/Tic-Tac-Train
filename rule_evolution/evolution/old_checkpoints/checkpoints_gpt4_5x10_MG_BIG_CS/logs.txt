The previous rule set is as follows:
"Based on these examples, we can create improved rules which will lead to optimal moves which the previous set of rules missed.

Rule 1 (Improved):
If there exists a line with an empty square, your mark, and either an empty square or opponent's mark in this order, or if there exists a line with an empty
 square, opponent's mark, and your mark in this order, place your mark in the empty square. If multiple such lines exist, prioritize (iteratively) diagonals
, and the square with the closest distance to the center.

Rule 2 (Improved):
Make a move that will force the opponent to block you. If a current move can create a situation where you have two winning moves in the next turn, and the o
pponent can only block one, make that move. If multiple such moves exist, prioritize the move creating a diagonal line.

Rule 3 (Unchanged):
If the center cell is unmarked, play there unless the opponent has a corner and you need to apply rule 1 or rule 2.

Rule 4 (Improved):
If the opponent has a corner, you do not have an immediate win or block according to rule 1 or 2, and the rest two diagonally facing cells are empty, place
your mark in one of those empty cells.

Rule 5 (Unchanged):
If all corners are taken and the opponent has two marks in a line with an empty square in between, avoid placing your mark in the empty square. Instead, pla
ce your mark in any unmarked edge square.

Rule 6 (Improved):
If there is an empty corner square opposite an opponent's corner mark, and there doesn't exist a more prioritized rule to apply, place your mark in that emp
ty cell.

Rule 7 (Unchanged):
If all corners are taken and there exists a line with an empty square, your mark, and an opponent's mark in this order, place your mark in the empty square.
 However, if an opponent can create a double threat with their next move, block one of the threats.

Rule 8 (Unchanged):
If your mark is in the center square and there exist empty edge squares, place your mark in such edge square unless a higher priority rule applies.

Rule 9 (Unchanged):
If all corners and the center square are taken, place your mark in an empty edge square unless a higher priority rule applies.

Rule 3 (Unchanged):
If the center cell is unmarked, play there unless the opponent has a corner and you need to apply rule 1 or rule 2.

Rule 4 (Improved):
If the opponent has a corner, you do not have an immediate win or block according to rule 1 or 2, and the diagonally facing corner cell is empty, place your
 mark there.

Rule 5 (Changed):
If none of the rules above apply and there are any corners unmarked, mark one. If the corners are marked and there are any edge squares unmarked, mark one.
Priority is given to squares that block the opponent's next possible win.

Rule 6 (New):
If there is an empty corner opposite an opponent's mark and applying the above rules does not result in a better move, place your mark in that corner.

Rule 7 (Unchanged):
If all corners are taken and there exists a line with an empty square, your mark, and an opponent's mark in this order, place your mark in the empty square.
 However, if an opponent can create a double threat with their next move, block one of the threats.

Rule 8 (Unchanged):
If your mark is in the center square and there exist empty edge squares, place your mark in such edge square unless a higher priority rule applies.

Rule 9 (Unchanged):
If all corners and the center square are taken, place your mark in an empty edge square unless a higher priority rule applies.

Rule 10 (Unchanged):
If none of the other rules apply, place your mark in any unmarked square. Prioritize squares that share an edge with opponent's marks or have the most adjac
ent unmarked squares.

e optimal plays that the previous rules may have missed.

Rule 1 (Improved):
If there exists a line with an empty square, your mark, and either an empty square or opponent's mark in this order, or if there exists a line with an empty
 square, opponent's mark, and your mark in this order, place your mark in the empty space. If multiple such lines exist, prioritize (iteratively) diagonals,
 and the square placing you in closest proximity to forming a line of three marks.

Rule 2 (Improved):
If another open square on the same line or column with your last move has an extra free adjacent square on the perpendicular direction, especially for the c
enter square, it will be a better choice. It will give you a chance to create more potential winning situations. Below shows an example where square a with
free adjacent square will be a better choice than the other square in the same line (denoted as b).
\begin{bmatrix}
a & - & b \\
- & X & O \\
- & - & - \\
\end{bmatrix}

Rule 3 (Unchanged):
If the center cell is unmarked, play there unless the opponent has a corner and you need to apply rule 1 or 2.

Rule 4 (New):
If the opponent just put a mark or block at a corner and the center is not yet marked, put your mark there.

Rule 5 (New):
After Rule 2, 3, always put your mark in an empty corner opposite an opponent's corner mark when you do not have a more urgent move according to other rules
. The opposite corners can be a base for a potential win situation.

Rule 6 (Improved):
If none of the rules above apply and there are any corners unmarked, mark one. If the corners are marked and there are any edge squares unmarked, mark one.
Priority is given to squares that form a line with your existing mark.

Rule 7 (Improved):
If all corners are taken, prefer to place your mark in a center edge square instead of a corner edge square to block an opponent's win or create more potent
ial win situation for yourself.

Rule 8 (Unchanged):
If your mark is in the center square and there exist empty edge squares, place your mark in such edge square unless a higher priority rule applies.

Rule 9 (Unchanged):
If all corners and the center square are taken, place your mark in an empty edge square unless a higher priority rule applies.

Rule 10 (Unchanged):
If none of the other rules apply, place your mark in any unmarked square. Prioritize squares that share an edge with opponent's marks or have the most adjac
ent unmarked squares.
