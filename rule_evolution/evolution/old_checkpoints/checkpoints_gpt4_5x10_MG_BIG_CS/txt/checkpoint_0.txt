Evolution(library='Since the previous rule set is "No rules," I\'ll create a completely new rule set.\n\nHere are the new 10 rules, listed in order of priority:\n\nRule 1 (New):\nIf there\'s an immediate win - a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) where you have two tiles filled and the third is empty - fill it.\n\nRule 2 (New):\nIf the opponent has a line where they have two tiles filled and the third is empty, block the line by filling the third spot.\n\nRule 3 (New):\nIf the center tile is open, fill it. The center spot, having the most immediate neighbors, is the most valuable for increasing potential win-lines.\n\nRule 4 (New):\nIf the opponent has filled a corner spot, choose the opposite corner if it\'s open.\n\nRule 5 (New):\nIf there\'s any corner spot open, fill it. Corners are more valuable than edge spots as it\'s involved in more potential win-lines (3 vs 2).\n\nRule 6 (New):\nIf you can fill the second tile in a line - set up a potential double-win scenario or close to an \'immediate win\'.\n\nRule 7 (New):\nIf the opponent can fill the second tile in a line - prevent a potential double-win scenario.\n\nRule 8 (New):\nIf there are no corners available and the center isn\'t open, choose an edge spot. Always choose the side-center position over an edge-corner position, as it has more potential win-lines.\n\nRule 9 (New):\nTake a spot that maximizes the total number of winning lines involving your marks.\n\nRule 10 (New):\nIf all else fail, choose randomly. Sometimes there is no optimal move and you may have to rely on luck.\n\nNote: These rules apply for the standard 3x3 tic-tac-toe.

Evolution(library="Given that there are no previous rules, let's develop a new strategy for tic-tac-toe.\n\nRule 1 (New):\nIf there is a winning move, take it. This can be mathematically defined as if there exists a row, column, or diagonal with n-1 same symbols with one spot empty where n is the size of board, place your symbol there.\n\nRule 2 (New):\nIf your opponent has a winning move on the next turn, block it. This situation can also be defined in the same way as in Rule 1 - if there exists a row, column, or diagonal with n-1 opponentâ€™s symbols and one empty spot, place your symbol there.\n\nRule 3 (New):\nIf you can create a fork (more than one potential row, column or diagonal to win), do it. This can be interpreted as if there are positions a, b such that both are empty and placing your symbol in either a or b leads to two rows, columns or diagonals with n-1 same symbols and one empty spot, place your symbol at either a or b.\n\nRule 4 (New):\nIf your opponent can create a fork on their next move, prevent it. This can be formulated like Rule 3 but with opponent's symbols instead of yours.\n\nRule 5 (New):\nIf you can create a move that forces the opponent only one way to block (like if there are n-2 same symbols on two different lines and the last open spot in these lines is the same), then do it.\n\nRule 6 (New):\nIf your opponent can create a forced move, block it. This is similar as in Rule 5 but with opponent's symbols instead.\n\nRule 7 (New):\nMake your moves in squares that provide potential for multiple wins. This means choosing squares that are part of as many rows, columns or diagonals as possible (i.e., corners then center then edges on a 3x3 board).\n\nRule 8 (New):\nAvoid moves that allow the opponent potential for multiple wins. This would be the inverse of Rule 7, but with opponent's symbols.\n\nRule 9 (New):\nWhen playing on a larger board and have no immediate threat or opportunity, prioritize placing symbols near the center as possible. This is based off the strategy that having more surrounding squares gives more potential for forks.\n\nRule 10 (New):\nWhen there is more than one equivalent option, choose randomly. This means if two or more options all have the same potential for fulfilling the above rules, a random choice among them will not affect the outcome.\n", formatting_accuracy=0.875, best_move_accuracy=0.2857142857142857, failed_sequences=[([8], [2, 5, 7, 9]), ([3, 9, 7, 5], [1]), ([4, 7, 9, 2, 3, 6, 5], [1]), ([8, 1, 6, 3, 5], [2]), ([3, 5, 7, 9], [1]), ([6, 4, 7], [3, 9]), ([5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4, 7], [9]), ([2, 1, 6, 7, 5], [4]), ([9, 5, 1, 7], [3]), ([9, 1, 3, 8, 4, 6, 5], [7])])

A "winning move" is any move that results in you having n side-by-side cells in any row, column, or diagonal on an nxn board.\n\nRule 2 (New):\nIf the opponent has one move that could lead them to win in their next turn, block that move. A "winning move" for the opponent is any move that will allow them to have n side-by-side cells in any row, column, or diagonal on an nxn board.\n\nRule 3 (New):\nIf the opponent has multiple winning moves that could lead them to win in their next turn, block the move that has the most number of your marks in that line, if equal, then randomly choose one to block.\n\nRule 4 (New):\nTry to create a fork such that you have two threats to win (two non-blocked lines of n-1 marks). \n\nRule 5 (New):\nIf the opponent could make a fork and create two threats to win on their next turn, block it by creating a mark where they could create the second threat. If multiple forks are possible for the opponent, block the one that results in the most threats.\n\nRule 5 (New):\nIf the center spot is free on an odd-sided board - like in the standard 3x3 game, or expanded 5x5, 7x7 game, and so on - place your mark in the center as this gives you the highest number of lines (rows, columns, diagonals) to win.\n\nRule 6 (New):\nIf your opponent is not in in a winning position in the next move and you can\'t win in the next move either, place your mark on the corner cell of the nxn board. \n\nRule 7 (New):\nIf your opponent is not in in a winning position in the next move and you can\'t win in the next move either, and there are no corners available, place your mark on a side cell.\n\nRule 8 (New):\nLook to block your opponent\'s moves that could lead him to win in the next two turns. \n\nRule 9 (New):\nIn the absence of any other strategic advantage, choose the cell with the maximum number of vacant adjacent cells.\n\nRule 10 (New):\nIf no other rules apply, make a random legal move, such that no consecutive cells in any row, column or diagonal are left vacant, if possible.', formatting_accuracy=0.8125, best_move_accuracy=0.23076923076923078, failed_sequences=[([2, 9, 6, 7, 5], [8]), ([3, 9, 7, 5], [1]), ([6, 1, 7], [3]), ([4, 7, 9, 2, 3, 6, 5], [1]), ([3, 5, 7, 9], [1]), ([6, 4, 7], [3, 9]), ([2, 1, 6, 7, 5], [4]), ([9, 5, 1, 7], [3]), ([4, 6, 3], [1, 7]), ([9, 1, 3, 8, 4, 6, 5], [7])])
