You will receive a rule set for playing tic-tac-toe. These are generalized rules that allow one to make the most optimal move given any game state.
If there are no rules, generate a new rule set. If there is a rule set, improve the rule set so that when it is applied, it will make the most optimal moves. 
Repeat rules word for word that you would like to keep unchanged. Add in your own best rules or improvements, or reorder the list as you wish.

For example:
Rule 1 (Unchanged):
...
Rule 2 (Improved):
...
Rule 3 (New):
...

Requirements: 
(1) Create rules that do not require running an algorithm, 
(2) Consider all important states of the game, such as near-wins of any kind,
(3) Rules should still work if the tic-tac-toe board is larger than a 3x3 board,
(4) Rules should be ordered by priority,
(5) Only 10 rules or less allowed in the rule set.
